  - One api. 
  - Behave:
      xdo_t
      when (mouse-leave, etc)
      what (window, ignored if when 'screen edge or corner')
      action (function)


Features

    - delay until acting (default = no delay) 
    - after acting, disable for some period (default = 100ms)
    - XSelectInput on all windows

  # Give a window the classname 'consoleme' then run this:
  xdotool search --classname consoleme set_window --overrideredirect 1 windowunmap behave_screen_edge left windowmap windowmove 0 0 windowsize --usehints 100% 24 windowfocus windowraise
  xdotool search --classname consoleme behave %@ mouse-leave windowunmap

  Move the mouse to the top edge of the screen to have your window show up.
  Move the mouse outside the window to have it hide again.
