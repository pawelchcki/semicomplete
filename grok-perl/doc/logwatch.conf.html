<h3> logwatch.conf </h3>

<h4> Syntax </h4>

<pre>
patterns { patternspec };
file "filename" { filespec };
exec "command" { filespec };
</pre>

<h5> patternspec </h5>
pattern specifiers let you define your own patterns to match and capture. Patterns can contain other patterns. Pattern definitions have the following syntax:
<pre>
patternname = "regexp";
</pre>

For example, if I want to define a pattern to match tty device paths:
<pre>
patterns {
	TTY = "/dev/tty/[qp][a-z0-9]";
};
</pre>

Now we can use %TTY% in our match expressions, which are covered further down
in this document. There are a few default patterns for your convenience. I will
detail those later. If you feel that you have an excellent pattern that should
be a default pattern, email me at psionic@csh.rit.edu and I'll add it to the
defaults :)

<h5> filespec </h5>
'file' and 'exec' both take the same kinds of options, becuase under the hood
they're handled in the same manner ('file' entries are actually executed as
"tail -0f [file]"). This is where you tell logwather to do the important work.
<p>

filespecs have entries called types. Types are given arbitrary but
hopefully-meaningful names. The names are mostly for documentation purposes as a
means by which to tell different "types" apart.

<p>

For the purposes of demonstration, let's take an example situtation and build a
config definition around it. We want to track failed su(1) attempts. In our
logs, we see the following in /var/log/messages:

<pre>
Feb 17 15:06:59  su: BAD SU jls to root on /dev/ttypd
</pre>

We need to tell logwatcher to watch /var/log/messages and look for a specific
pattern:
<p>

In '/home/jls/logwatch.conf'
<pre>
patterns {
	TTY = "/dev/tty[qp][a-z0-9]";
};

file "/var/log/messages" {
	type "failed su(1) attempt" {
		match = "BAD SU %USERNAME% to root on %TTY%";
		reaction = "logger -t 'su_audit' 'User %USERNAME% attempted to gain root access from %TTY%";
	};
};
</pre>

Now, we can run logwatcher:

<pre>
logwatcher -f /home/jls/logwatch.conf -d 1
</pre>

We run in debug level 1 just to ensure things that are running properly. While
logwatcher is running, fail a su(1) attempt from a normal user to root, and
watch /var/log/messages or the output of logwatcher:

output from logwatcher (when using '-d 1'):
<pre>
logwatcher[985]: Executing (from failed su(1) attempt/USERNAME=>jls/TTY=>/dev/ttypd): logger -t 'su_audit' 'User jls attempted to gain root access from /dev/ttypd'
</pre>

output in /var/log/messages from logger(1) execution:
<pre>
Feb 17 16:11:05  su_audit: User jls attempted to gain root access from /dev/ttyp9
</pre>

This seems all well and good, right? However, if you look at the log line,
there's some still potentially useful information we aren't capturing: the user
attempting to be switched to. For this, we need to cover the pattern capture
system a bit deeper.

<h5> Named-Pattern Capture System </h5>

Logwatcher isn't just for people who know regular expressions. Certainly,
knowing these will speed up the customization of logwatcher for your own needs,
but by no means is it requisite knowledge. Logwatcher has a system of named
pattern expressions. These named patterns can be used in any of the following
fields in the 'type' sections of filespecs: match, key, and reaction.

<p>

Named patterns are keywords surrounded by percent signs, and look like this:

<pre> %USERNAME% </pre>

This is the USERNAME pattern. It is a standard pattern in logwatcher that is
evaluated at runtime and replaced with a meaningful regular expression that
hopefully matches a username. The particular regex it is replaced with is
<code>\w+</code>. The idea behind the named pattern system was to make writing
match and reactions as easy as possible. A simple replacement is not all that
occurs when replacing %USERNAME% with its regular expression. The value matched
by %USERNAME% is captured and stored in a data structure for later retrieval -
in the reactions.

<p>

However, I found that I often wanted to use the same pattern multiple times in the same match expression, but there was no way for me to differentiate between one %USERNAME% match and another. To solve this, you are now able to subname pattern matches. The syntax for this is:

<pre>
%PATNAME:SUBNAME%
</pre>

where PATNAME is the name of the pattern, such as USERNAME, and the SUBNAME can be any uniquely identifying keyword you decide to give to this particular match. This allows you to distinctively name each pattern if you are in a situation where you might want to capture two %USERNAME% fields and use both in your reaction.

<p>

To best example how this can be used, lets improve on our existing logwatcher config and track both what user is running su(1) and what user they are attempting to switch to:

<pre>
file "/var/log/messages" {
   type "failed su(1) attempt" {
      match = "BAD SU %USERNAME:FROM% to %USERNAME:TO% on %TTY%";
      reaction = "logger -t 'su_audit' 'User %USERNAME:FROM% attempted su(1) to %USERNAME:TO% from %TTY%'";
   };
};
</pre>

Restart logwatcher, and lets try the following commands:

<pre>
laptop% su

laptop% su testing
</pre>

If you watch /var/log/messages, you should see something along the lines of:

<pre>
Feb 17 16:32:19  su_audit: User jls attempted su(1) to root from /dev/ttypb
Feb 17 16:32:26  su_audit: User jls attempted su(1) to testing from /dev/ttypb
</pre>

So now we capture both who the user is and who they are attempting to switch
to. Notice the use of %USERNAME:FROM% in both the match and reaction, and how
you don't have to use any regular expressions in the match expression.

<h5> match types specification </h5>
'type' definitions go inside file and exec blocks. Types must be given
identifiable names in strings followed by a block of a type entry.

<pre>
file "/var/log/messages" {
	type "this is the type name" {
		#type entry goes here
	};
};
</pre>

Type entries include the following:

<dl>
<dt>match</dt>
<dd>
<b>Syntax:</b> match = "string pattern to match";<br>
<b>Example:</b> match = "Illegal user %USERNAME% from %IP%";<br>
<i>You can have multiple match entries per 'type' definition.</i><br>

Matches are quoted strings containing patterns. These patterns are any valid
regular expression and allow named patterns (such as %USERNAME%).
</dd>

<dt>key</dt>
<dd>
<b>Syntax:</b> key = "somestring";<br>
<b>Example:</b> key = "%IP%";<br>
This specifies the key to use in the internal hashtable when counting occurances
of a specific event. The default key is generated by concatonating all of the
captured patterns into a single string. this may not be desirable in all
circumstances, so you are allowed to specify your own key string. Pattern names
are valid here and will be evaluated at runtime. So using %IP% means that it
will be keyed by the %IP% matched.

<dt>threshold</dt>
<dd>
<b>Syntax:</b> threshold = <i>integer</i>;<br>
<b>Example:</b> threshold = 5;<br>
Thresholds specify the limit of occurances of a specific match by its key. After
this threshold is exceeded, the reaction(s) are executed and the occurance count
is reset to 0. <i>The default threshold is 1-ish. If no threshold is specified,
every event occurance will trigger reaction execution.</i>
</dd>

<dt>interval</dt>
<dd>
<b>Syntax:</b> interval = <i>integer</i>;<br>
<b>Example:</b> interval = 600; </br>
Specify the interval for the threshold reset. If the threshold event count is
not exceeded before the interval expires, then the threshold is reset and no
reaction is executed.
</dd>

<dt>reaction</dt>
<dd>
<i> Multiple reactions can be specified per 'type' definition </i><br>
<b>Syntax (normal commands):</b> reaction = "command to execute";<br>
<b>Syntax (perl blocks):</b> reaction = { perl code };<br>
<b>Example (normal comamnd):</b> reaction = "pfctl -t naughty -T add %IP%";<br>
<b>Example (perl block):</b> <pre>
	reaction = {
		debug(0, "I found a naughty IP: " . $v->{"IP"});
	};
</pre>

<h5> Reactions: Normal Commands </h5>
These can be any valid command, or string of commands. The execution of the
command string is using perl's system() function, so feel free to use anything
that command supports. Named patterns will be expanded to their captured values
here, so %IP% will be replaced with the IP that was matched in the capture.

<p>

<h5> Reactions: Perl Blocks </h5>
You are allowed to embed perl blocks of any(?) length in reactions in the
block-form listed above. Newlines are not required. Any valid perl should work.
Inside these blocks, you are given a few helper variables:
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<code>$v</code> - this is a hashref containing all of the named patterns
matched. For example, if you match on %IP%, you can access the value matched
with <code>$v->{"IP"}</code>. Subnamed patterns can be accessed in by intuitive
keys; ie, if you used %IP:INBOUND% you can access the value matched with
<code>$v->{"IP:INBOUND"}</code>.
</li>
<li>
<code>$d</code> - a hashref provided to you for your own personal storage. The
hashref itself comes from internal storage keyed by the key generated for this
particular match. Make certain you specify your own key if you do not want to
use the default! An example of using this might be:
<pre>
	debug(0, "%IP% has poked me " . ++$d->{$v->{"IP"}} . " times");
</pre>

This allows you some pretty significant flexibility in terms of what you can do
with the data once it has been matched.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4> Examples </h4>

This first example is pretty much verbatim what we've covered here in this document:
<blockquote>
<pre>
# Example looking for failed su(1) attempts and logging them.
patterns {
   TTY = "/dev/tty[qp][a-z0-9]";
};

file "/var/log/messages" {
   type "failed su(1) attempt" {
      match = "BAD SU %USERNAME:FROM% to %USERNAME:TO% on %TTY%";
      reaction = "logger -t 'su_audit' 'User %USERNAME:FROM% attempted su(1) to %USERNAME:TO% from %TTY%'";
   };
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

The next example shows my primary use of logwatcher - to audit auth.log for bruteforce or other naughtiness happenning on sshd. Potential naughty hosts are blocked by the firewall after they exceed the threshold.
<blockquote>
<pre>
# Example watching auth.log for brute force ssh attempts
file "/var/log/auth.log" {
   type "ssh-illegal-user" {
      match = "Illegal user %USERNAME% from %IP%";
      threshold = 10;   # 10 hits ...
      key = "%IP%";     # from a single ip ...
      interval = 600;   # in 10 minutes
      reaction = "pfctl -t whores -T add %IP%";
   };

   # Caveat emptor: 'did not receive identification' is not necessarily an
   # indication of something naughty going on
   type "ssh-scan-possible" {
      match = "Did not receive identification string from %IP%";
      threshold = 3;
      interval = 60;
      reaction = "pfctl -t whores -T add %IP%";
   };
};
</pre>
</blockquote>

This next example demonstrates both the 'exec' feature and some of the real
power you can use with logwatcher. Here, I'll be running tcpdump and grokking
the output for useful purposes. Realistically, this example is not very useful
in the real world, becuase watching traffic is best handled by an IDS like
Snort. Anyway, on with the example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
# Example using 'exec' - let's grok tcpdump for fun and profit.
exec "tcpdump -li lo0 -n 2&lt; /dev/null" {
  type "ssh-connect" {
  match = "%IP:SRC%.\d+ &lt; %IP:DST%.22: S";
     reaction = "echo 'SSH connect(): %IP:SRC% -&lt; %IP:DST%'";
  };
  type "port-scan" {
     match = "%IP:SRC%.%PORT% &lt; %IP:DST%.%PORT:DST%: S";
     key = "%IP:SRC%";
     threshold = 30;
     interval = 5; 
     reaction = "echo 'Port scan from %IP:SRC%'";
  };
};
</pre>

If I do 'nmap -sT 192.168.0.1' the following shows up as output from logwatcher:
<pre>
Port scan from 192.168.0.1
Port scan from 192.168.0.1
Port scan from 192.168.0.1
Port scan from 192.168.0.1
</pre>

If I ssh to the machine, 192.168.0.1:
<pre>
SSH connect(): 192.168.0.2 -&lt; 192.168.0.1
</pre>
