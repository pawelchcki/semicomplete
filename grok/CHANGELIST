  - Add grok rpm spec.
  - Updated Makefile to work on Linux and FreeBSD without modification.
  - Fixed bug introduced in 20091022 where capture_by_(name,subname) didn't
    work properly.
  - Add default values for match {} grok.conf blocks:
    shell: stdout
    reaction: "%{@LINE}"
  - Have grok exit nonzero if there were no reactions executed, akin to grep(1)
    not matching anything. 'reactions' are important here; matches with no
    reaction will not count as a reaction.

  - Fix libgrok accidentally sharing it's parser/lexer functions. Turns out,
    libgrok doesn't actually need to parse the grok.conf, so we don't build
    against it anymore for the library.

20091022:
  - Convert to using tokyocabinet instead of berkeley db.
    * Berkeley DB isn't easy to target across platforms (4.x versions vary
      wildly in bugs)
    * tokyo cabinet should be faster
    * tokyo cabinet is less code to write, and slightly more readable in the
      author's opinion.  
    * we don't have to serialize with xdr anymore
  
20091019:
  - include pregenerated bison/flex output since gnu flex varies much from
  non-gnu flex, and many important platforms don't have gnu flex available
  easily from packages (freebsd, centos, etc) but come with the other flex.

  No functional changes.

20090928:
  - perl grok is dead. Long live new grok.
  - This code should be considered usable, but beta quality.
