  - Convert to using tokyocabinet instead of berkeley db.
    * Berkeley DB isn't easy to target across platforms (4.x versions vary wildly in bugs)
    * tokyo cabinet should be faster
    * tokyo cabinet is less code to write, and slightly more readable in the author's opinion.
    * we don't have to serialize with xdr anymore

  - include pregenerated bison/flex output since gnu flex varies much from
  non-gnu flex, and many important platforms don't have gnu flex available
  easily from packages (freebsd, centos, etc) but come with the other flex.

  No functional changes.

  - perl grok is dead. Long live new grok.
  - This code should be considered usable, but beta quality.
