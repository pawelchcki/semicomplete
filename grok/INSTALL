Dependencies:
  The following are the dependency versions known to work:

    Build dependencies:
      bison        >= 2.3
      flex         >= 2.5.35
      gperf        >= 3.0
      GNU make     >= 3.81

    Run dependencies:
      libevent     >= 1.3 (older versions may work)
      libpcre      >= 7.6
      Berkeley DB  >= 4.5

    Test suite dependencies:
      CUnit        >= 2.1

Building:
  make grok    (or 'gmake grok' if your make is not gnu make)

Installing:
  make install

Platforms:
  This has been tested on Linux and FreeBSD. All tests pass in both Linux. It
  should work elsewhere. I haven't run all tests on FreeBSD, yet.
  
FreeBSD Notes:
  You'll need to specify additional arguments to define where headers and
  libraries are. There's an example in the Makefile under 'For FreeBSD' for
  getting the right bdb library linked.
