= Introduction =

Grok is simple software that allows you to easily parse logs and other files. You teach grok how to parse data through the config file. Grok is a system for reacting to events - those events being log entries.

The grok library is a great choice when you need the pattern matching features of grok in your own tools. There are currently C and Ruby APIs.
