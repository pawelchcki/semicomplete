#summary Documentation on the supported predicate operators

= Predicates =

Predicates let you add additional requirements to your matches. They allow you to further restrict a match without having to rewrite a pattern.

For example, if you want to match an IP that starts with 192.168, that's easy:
{{{
program {
  load-patterns: "patterns/base"
  exec "ifconfig"

  match {
    pattern: "%{IP =~ /^192.168/}"
    reaction: "Found: %{IP}"
  }
}
}}}

Output:
{{{
% grok samples/ip-predicate.grok   
Found: 192.168.0.97
}}}

Without the '=~ /^192.168/' predicate, our output is:
{{{
Found: 192.168.0.97
Found: 127.0.0.1
}}}
