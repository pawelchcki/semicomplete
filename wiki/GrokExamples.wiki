#summary Useful examples of grok.

= Watching logs for errors =

Uses: since, cron, grok.

For this example,you could do this all in grok, but I find it works easier using cron given cron's builtin email capability.

{{{
program {
  exec "since -a /var/log/messages"

  # Ignore certain messages
  match {
    pattern: "this is not an error"

    # Silence the output and ensure no further matches are attempted.
    reaction: none        # no output
    break-if-match: yes   # don't continue to the next match
  }

  match {
    pattern: "error"
  }
}
}}}
