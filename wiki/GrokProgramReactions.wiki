#summary details about the 'reaction' values in grok configs.

= Reactions =

A reaction can be any string. Any %{value} values are replaced with the appropriated capture. You can also apply filter functions.

= Reaction Filters =

Filters are used for translating a capture value before sending to the reaction shell.

Below is an example that will use the 'shellescape' filter to escape all characters in a value to as to be safe in a shell context.
{{{
program {
  load-patterns: "patterns/base"
  exec "echo '$something \"testing\"'"

  match {
    pattern: ".*"
    reaction: "Shell will get: echo %{@LINE|shellescape}"
  }


  match {
    pattern: ".*"
    reaction: "echo %{@LINE|shellescape}"
    shell: "/bin/sh"
  }
} 
}}}

== Available Filters ==

* shellescape - escapes all characters necessary to make the string safe in non-quoted a shell argument
* shelldqescape - escapes characters necessary to be safe within doublequotes in a shell.
* jsonencode - makes the string safe to represent in a json string (escapes according to json.org recommendations)
