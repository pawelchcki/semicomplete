1.20100416.*
  - Trim extra trailing whitespace
  - Fix crashing
  - Provide rpm spec

20071119 -
  - Add nongreedy tokenizer. Same semantics of strtok_r(), but doesn't skip
    empty tokens.
  - Renamed tokenizer to split, since really that's what it was doing.
  - You can invoke the nongreedy tokenizer by using '?' as the first character
    of a {} set:
     args: :{?4,6}
     input: one:::four::six
     output: four:six

20071028 -
  - Add snprintf_2.2 for platform (aka Solaris) lacking asprintf.
  - Fix 'make package' to work in Solaris
  - Add COPYRIGHT (BSD License)

20071026 - First major release
  - Added some tests
  - If you want to specify a different first split token, the first character
    can be any non-digit character which is not '-' or '{'.

    These are now equivalent:
    % echo "foo/bar/baz" | fex 0/2
    bar
    % echo "foo/bar/baz" | fex /2
    bar

    Previously, this would give an error due to intentional design.
