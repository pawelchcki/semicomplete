  Hosts can have services and tests.
  Services can have hosts and tests.
  Tests are just commands, run like this:
    /bin/sh -c <command>
    With your command as argv[2]. No escaping is necessary.
    We set environment variables based on what caused the test to run:
      * Host data is prefixed with HOST_, like HOST_NAME
      * Service data is prefixed with SERVICE_, like SERVICE_NAME
      * Test data is prefixed with TEST_, like TEST_COMMAND
