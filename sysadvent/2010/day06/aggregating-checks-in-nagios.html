<h1>Aggregating Nagios Checks for Better Alerting</h1>

<p><em>This article was written by <a href="http://www.semicomplete.com/">Jordan Sissel</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/jordansissel">@jordansissel</a>)</em></p>

<p>Chances are that your infrastructure has more than one machine performing the
same role - frontend (webapps, etc), backend (databases, log collectors, etc),
middleware (message brokers, proxies, etc), support services (config
management, etc). Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more server
resources, right?</p>

<p>Monitoring a horizontally scaled system can often lead to unintended noise. You
might have 10 web servers, but 3 are broken, so you get 3 alerts. Maybe you
monitor ssh health on all 50 of your servers, and someone pushed a bad config
or there is a bad network connection, and now all 50 servers are alerting you
about failures. Further, I believe that monitoring alerts (things that page
you) should generally be business-oriented, not
single-metric-and-single-server-oriented.</p>

<p>Even if you aren't running systems with duplicate roles, it often makes sense
to collect multiple individual health checks into a single alert.</p>

<p>This calls for aggregating your data. Benefits of aggregation are increased 
alert value while decreasing alert noise. Noisy monitoring systems often result in
yourself (and others) unconsciously training to ignore that system - don't let
your monitoring servers <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf">cry, "Wolf!"</a>.
Further, alerting on aggregates means you can do cool things like only alerting
if, for example, more than 5% of things are failing - assuming that's safe for
your business.</p>

<p>If you could keep the existing checks you have, not alert on them, but add
aggregate checks that cause alerting, you could maintain your current
fine-grain monitoring while improving alerting in both noise level and business
relevance! Sounds like win-win.</p>

<p>There are some solutions for this already, like
<a href="http://my-plugin.de/wiki/projects/check_multi/configuration/file">check_multi</a>.
but I didn't want to run additional or duplicate checks. Why? Some checks may
take a long time (like a complex Selenium test), or may be resource-intensive
to run (like verifying a large backup), or may not scale if I have to run 200 of
them to answer one aggregated health check.</p>

<p>So, I took a different approach. Nagios already records <a href="http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/3_0/configmain.html#status_file">state in a file on
disk</a>, so
we can parse that file and produce an aggregate check. Lucky for me, there are
already tools that parse this format, so most of
the work is done already (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/nagiosity/">nagiosity</a>,
<a href="http://mathias-kettner.de/checkmk_livestatus.html">checkmk_livestatus</a>, and
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/ruby-nagios/">ruby-nagios</a>). I picked ruby-nagios, for no particular reason. It didn't require much
hacking to add what I needed. The result is
<a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/nagios-manage">nagios-manage</a> and a tool:
<code>check_check.rb</code> (comes with the nagios-manage rubygem).</p>

<p>Notes: Currently, this tool assumes a few things about what I want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Skips checks that have notifications disabled</li>
<li>Skips checks that are marked in downtime</li>
<li>Only uses the <code>hard</code> state. If it is in <code>soft critical</code>, for example, it will
assume the previous <code>hard</code> state.</li>
</ul>

<p>The above constraints let me aggregate other nagios-state data into health that
is deemed important - if one server is down for maintenance or has a known
failure, I don't want to alert about it.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre><code># Summarize all checks for all hosts:
% check_check.rb
OK=110 WARNING=0 CRITICAL=0 UNKNOWN=0 services=// hosts=// 

# Summarize solr checks, when one check is failing:
% check_check.rb -s solrserver
OK=27 WARNING=0 CRITICAL=1 UNKNOWN=0 services=/solrserver/ hosts=// 
Services in CRITICAL:
  frontend1.example.com =&gt; solrserver client tests
</code></pre>

<p>The result in nagios looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_u-5lMShiO40/TPyrT6Io2GI/AAAAAAAAAGA/hfsdcMj44b4/nagios-check_check.png" alt="nagios check_check" title="" /></p>

<p>By the way, the no-argument invocation is super useful for, from the command
line, checking the overall health of everything nagios monitors.</p>

<p>For the solrserver check above, I would create one single check that would run
the above <code>check_check.rb</code> command and alert appropriately. This saves me from
having 28 potentially-failing-and-alerting checks. Further, if I get an alert
about 1 critical check, I still have the further fine-grained alerting per
server, so I can easily drill into what is failing.</p>

<p>Summarizing: I still have monitoring doing fine-grained, individual checks,
like cpu usage, network activity, server behaviors, etc, but individual checks
do not cause alerts themselves. This means setting the <code>contacts</code> for your
individual checks to something that won't alert you. Instead, I use
<code>check_check.rb</code> to aggregate results to reduce noise and to collect relevant
data - alerting only on important failures in a way that doesn't flood the
pager and helps me better indicate business-service problems to those on call.</p>
