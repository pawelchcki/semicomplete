# DevOps for the Systems Administrator #

## Intro ##

This article is part one of a two part series by [Brandon Burton][solarce]
which explores what [DevOps][devops] is and what it means for the Systems
Administrator (in all his/her many forms), where it has come since Brandon's
[article][reliamdevops] in July, and where you should be looking if you want to
be involved.

Part one focuses on what DevOps and what it means for the Systems
Administrator.

## DevOps and what it means for the Systems Administrator ##

DevOps is really just a label for a a rallying point around a variety of trends
(primarily lead by Web Operations) that have begun to coalesce over the last
couple of years. These trends, ideas, and tools have existed in various forms
and have been adopted to various extents for many years, but have seen a huge
coming together in the last two years. Early voices in this area include  [John
Allspaw's][allspaw] [talk at Velocity 2009][allspawtalk]] and [Patrick
Debois's][patrick] [coining][devopscoin] of the 'DevOps' term, and
is covered well by a [writeup][camspost] by [John M. Willis][john]

### CAMS ###

The principles that DevOps is about are best summarized as `CAMS`, the four
pillars of DevOps.  `CAMS` is:

#### Culture ####

>People and process first.  If you don’t have culture, all automation attempts
>will be fruitless.

#### Automation ####

>This is one of the places you start once you understand your culture.  At this
>point, the tools can start to stitch together an automation fabric for DevOps.
>Tools for release management, provisioning, configuration management, systems
>integration, monitoring and control, and orchestration become important pieces
>in building a DevOps fabric.

#### Measurement ####

>If you can’t measure, you can’t improve.  A successful DevOps implementation
>will measure everything it can as often as it can… performance metrics,
process
>metrics, and even people metrics.

#### Sharing ####

>Sharing is the loopback in the CAMS cycle.  Creating a culture where people
>share ideas and problems is critical.
>Another interesting motivation in the DevOps movement is the way sharing
>DevOps success stories helps others.   First, it attracts talent, and second,
>there is a belief that by exposing ideas you can create a great open feedback
>that in the end helps them improve.

### Why it's important ###

DevOps is important because it represents a shift in the way we are thinking
about and practicing operations and how we are interact with developers -- and
beyond to other groups within businesses.

DevOps is important because it is about helping, it's about an attitude that
says, "I'm going to make a difference, I'm going to cooperate and communicate,
and I'm going to understand that in the business of delivering great software,
we're all in it together."

DevOps is important because DevOps-centric user groups, conferences, and
discussions are where you will see the next wave of thoughts, tools, and best
practices come out of in the coming years, particularly in the web
operations/web application space.

### For the Systems Administrator ###

Don't let any potential *hype* or the the fact that the discussion seems
focused on things like the cloud, nosql, or agile deter you. DevOps represents
the things that Systems Administrators love and advocate.

It's about planning for failure, choosing good tools, creating and using good
lines of communications.  Half of DevOps is operations, and operations is
systems administrators. DevOps advocates ensuring systems administrators are
involved in the design process and architectural decisions. It's about
promoting operations as a provider of value and not as a cost center.

I think that as systems administrators we can see the value in these things
being given a voice and DevOps represents an opportunity to be a part of an
ongoing conversation and see the values, tools, and practices we believe in
reach a wider audience and wider adoption.

more and get involved
