Going Parallel
===================

_This article was written by [Brandon Burton](http://www.inatree.org/), aka [@solarce](http://www.twitter.com/solarce)_.

As system administrators, we are often faced with tasks that need to run
against a number of things, perhaps files, users, servers, etc.  In most cases,
we resort of a loop of some sort, often, just a for loop in the shell.  The
drawback to this seemingly obvious approach, is that we are constrained by the
fact that this approach is serial and so the time it will take increases linearly
with the number of things we are running the task against.

I am here to tell you there is a better way, it is the path of going parallel!

Tools for your shell scripts
------------------------------

The first place to start is with tools that can replace that `for` loop you
usually use and add some parallelism to the task you are running.

The two most well known tools that are available are:

1. [xargs](http://ss64.com/bash/xargs.html)
2. [gnu parallel](http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)

```xargs``` is a tool used to build and execute command lines from standard
input, but one of its great features is that it can execute those command lines
in parallel via its ```-P``` argument.  A quick example of this is:

    seq 10 20 | xargs -n 1 -P 5 sleep
    
This will send a sequence of numbers to xargs and divide it into chunks of one
argument (`-n 1`) at a time and fork off 5 parallel processes (`-P 5`) to
execute each. You can see it in action:

    $ ps -eaf | grep sleep
    baron     5830  5482  0 11:12 pts/2    00:00:00 xargs -n 1 -P 5 sleep
    baron     5831  5830  0 11:12 pts/2    00:00:00 sleep 10
    baron     5832  5830  0 11:12 pts/2    00:00:00 sleep 11
    baron     5833  5830  0 11:12 pts/2    00:00:00 sleep 12
    baron     5834  5830  0 11:12 pts/2    00:00:00 sleep 13
    baron     5835  5830  0 11:12 pts/2    00:00:00 sleep 14

```gnu parallel``` is a lesser known tool, but has been gaining popularity
recently. It is written with the specific focus on executing processes in
parallel.  From the home page description: _"GNU parallel is a shell tool for
executing jobs in parallel locally or using remote machines. A job is typically
a single command or a small script that has to be run for each of the lines in
the input. The typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a list of
users, a list of URLs, or a list of tables."_

A quick example of using ```parallel``` is:

    % cat offlineimap-cron5min.plist | parallel --max-procs=8 --group 'echo "Thing: {}"'
    Thing:       <string>offlineimap-cron5min</string> 
    Thing:     <key>Label</key> 
    Thing:       <string>solarce</string> 
    Thing:     <key>UserName</key> 
    Thing:   <dict> 
    Thing:     <key>ProgramArguments</key> 
    Thing:       <string>admin</string> 
    ...

This `plist` file is xml, but the output of parallel is unordered above because
each line of input is processed by one of the 8 workers and output occurs
(`--group`) as each worker finishes an input (line) and not necessarily in the
order of input.

Tools for multiple machines
-----------------------------

The next step in our journey is to progress from just running parallel
processes to running our tasks in parallel on multiple machines.

A common approach to this is to use something like the following:

    for server in $(cat list_of_servers.txt); do
        ssh $server command argument
    done
    
While this approach is fine for small tasks on a small number of machines, the
drawback to it is that it is executed linearly, so the total time the job will
take is _as long as the task takes to finish multiplied by the number of machines you are
executing it on_, which means it could take a while, so you'd better get a
Snickers.

Fortunately, people have recognized this problem and have developed a number of
tools have been developed to solve this, by running your SSH commends in
parallel.

These include:

* [pssh](http://www.theether.org/pssh/)
* [sshpt](http://code.google.com/p/sshpt/)
* [mussh](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mussh/)
* [clusterssh](http://sourceforge.net/projects/clusterssh/)

I'll illustrate how these work with a few examples.

First, here is a basic example of [pssh](http://www.theether.org/pssh/) (_on
Ubuntu the package is 'pssh,' but the command is 'parallel-ssh'_):
    
    # cat hosts-file
    p1
    p2

    # pssh -h hosts-file -l ben date
    [1] 21:12:55 [SUCCESS] p2 22
    [2] 21:12:55 [SUCCESS] p1 22

    # pssh -h hosts-file -l ben -P date
    p2: Thu Oct 16 21:14:02 EST 2008
    p2: [1] 21:13:00 [SUCCESS] p2 22
    p1: Thu Sep 25 15:44:36 EST 2008
    p1: [2] 21:13:00 [SUCCESS] p1 22
    
Second, here is an example of using [sshpt](http://code.google.com/p/sshpt/):

    ./sshpt -f ../testhosts.txt "echo foo" "echo bar"
    Username: myuser
    Password:
    "devhost","SUCCESS","2009-02-20 16:20:10.997818","0: echo foo
    1: echo bar","0: foo
    1: bar"
    "prodhost","SUCCESS","2009-02-20 16:20:11.990142","0: echo foo
    1: echo bar","0: foo
    1: bar"
    
As you can see, these tools simplify and parallelize your SSH commands,
decreasing the execution time that your tasks take and improving your
efficiency.

Smarter tools for multiple machines
--------------------------------------------------------
    
Once you've adopted the mindset your tasks can be done in parallel and you've
started using one of the parallel ssh tools for executing ad-hoc commands in a
parallel fashion, you may find yourself thinking that you'd like to be able to
execute tasks in parallel, but in a more repeatable, extensible, and organized
fashion.

If you were thinking this, you are in a luck.  There is a class of tools
commonly classified as _Command and Control_ or _Orchestration_ tools. These
tools include:

* [marionette collective aka mcollective](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/)
* [func](https://fedorahosted.org/func/)
* [fabric, aka fab](http://docs.fabfile.org/0.9.3/)
* [capistrano, aka cap](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki/Documentation-v2.x)

These tools are built to be frameworks within which you can build repeatable
systems automation.  Mcollective and capistrano are written in Ruby, and Func
and Fabric are written in Python. This gives you options for whichever language
you prefer.  Each has strengths and weaknesses.  I'm a big fan of Mcollective in particular, because it has
the strength of being built on [Puppet](http://www.puppetlans.com/) and its
primary author, [R.I. Pienaar](http://www.devco.net/) has a vision for it to
become an extremely versatile tool for the kinds of needs that fall within the
realm of _Command and Control_ or _Orchestration_.

As it's always easiest to grasp a tool by seeing it in action, here are basic
examples of using each tool:

**mcollective**

    % mc-package install zsh

     * [ ============================================================> ] 3 / 3

    web2.my.net                      version = zsh-4.2.6-3.el5
    web3.my.net                      version = zsh-4.2.6-3.el5
    web1.my.net                      version = zsh-4.2.6-3.el5

    ---- package agent summary ----
               Nodes: 3 / 3
            Versions: 3 * 4.2.6-3.el5
        Elapsed Time: 16.33 s

**func**

    % func client15.example.com call hardware info
    {'client15.example.com': {'bogomips': '7187.63',
                              'cpuModel': 'Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.60GHz',
                              'cpuSpeed': '3590',
                              'cpuVendor': 'GenuineIntel',
                              'defaultRunlevel': '3',
    ...
                              'systemSwap': '8191',
                              'systemVendor': 'Dell Inc.'}}

**fabric**

    % fab -H localhost,linuxbox host_type
    [localhost] run: uname -s
    [localhost] out: Darwin
    [linuxbox] run: uname -s
    [linuxbox] out: Linux

    Done.
    Disconnecting from localhost... done.
    Disconnecting from linuxbox... done.

**capistrano**

    # cap invoke COMMAND="yum -y install zsh"
      * executing `invoke'
      * executing "yum -y install zsh"
        servers: ["web1", "web2", "web3"]
        [web2] executing command
        [web1] executing command
        [web3] executing command
        [out :: web3] Nothing to do
        [out :: web2] Nothing to do
        [out :: web1] Complete!
        command finished
        
As you can see from these brief examples, each of these tools accomplishes
similar things, each one has a unique ecosystem, plugins available, and
strengths and weaknesses, a description of which, is beyond the scope of this
post.

Taking your own script(s) multithreaded
-----------------------------------------

The kernel of this article was an article I recently wrote for my employer's
blog, [Taking your script
multithreaded](http://www.reliam.com/company/featured_geek), in which I
detailed how I wrote a Python script to make an rsync job multithreaded and cut
the execution time of a task from approximately 6 hours, down to 45 minutes.

I've created a [git repo](https://github.com/solarce/multithreaded-example) out
of the script, so you can take my code and poke at it.  If you end up using the
script and make improvements, feel free to send me patches!

With the help of [David Grieser](http://twitter.com/#!/davidgrieser), there is
also a [Ruby]() port of the script up on Github.

These are two good examples of how you can easily implement a multithreaded
version of your own scripts to help parallelize your tasks.

Conclusion
-----------

There are clearly many steps you can take along the path to going parallel.
I've tried to highlight how you can begin with using tools to execute commands
in a more parallel fashion, progress to tools which help you execute ad-hoc and
then repeatable tasks across many hosts, and finally, given some examples on
how to make your own scripts more parallel.
