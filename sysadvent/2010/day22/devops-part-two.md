# DevOps: Where Are We Now? #

## Intro ##

This article is part two of a two part series by [Brandon Burton][solarce]
which explores what [DevOps][devops] is and why it matters, where it has come
since Brandon's [article][reliamdevops] in July, and where you should be
looking if you want to be involved.

Part two focuses on where DevOps has come since July and where you should be
looking if you want to be involved.

## What's happened since July ##

Back in July, I wrote an article entitled [DevOps (and Reliam) and why it
matters][reliamdevops] which covered the idea of ```CAMS```, discussed briefly
where Reliam sees DevOps fitting into its business, and highlighted a number of
resources for following with growth of DevOps. Things have been very busy since
then.  There has been an explosion of blogs, articles, conferences, user
groups, and online discussion about DevOps.

If you're still a little unsure what this DevOps thing is all about, I'd highly
recommend you read or revisit the following URLs before digging into the rest
of the content in this article.

* [What DevOps means to me][kartar]
* [What Is This DevOps Thing, Anyway?][jedi]

Since DevOps is first and foremost about people, the most exciting goings on
since July have been the meetups, conference talks, and videos people have been
producing.
