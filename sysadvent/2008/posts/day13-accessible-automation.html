Modern systems administration often involves saving yourself (and your company) time
and money. If I had to list skills (of people) and features (of software) by priority, automation would be near the top.

<p>

This is usually why I get so mad at software that doesn't lend itself easily to
automation.

Day 6
</a>
pointed out some potential difficulty in automating Tripwire. I'm willing to
forgive Tripwire since it's security software. I don't expect security guys to
think about systems administration problems.

<p>

But what about something like Cacti? Cacti is a monitoring tool aimed at helping you 
track data and data trends on your systems. You can configure it to graph many 
things on many hosts; sounds like a systems
administration tool, right?  Monitoring sounds sysadmin-ey. Transitivity from
sysadmin goes to automation. Therefore, I expect that Cacti will fall happily into my family of other automated configurations. If I have a few hundred machines in various, known 
configurations, can I easily put this data into Cacti and keep it up to date?

<p>

Cacti's main interface is a web interface, and such things do not easily 
lend themselves to automation.

<p>

Searching for 'cacti automation' will point you at Cacti's <a
href="http://docs.cacti.net/?q=node/529">command-line scripts</a>
(add_device.php, for example). These scripts only support adding things, not
modifying or deleting them. If you want to do that, you're almost on your own.
Automation features started showing up in Cacti 0.8.6 from a feature request
that there was no way to mass add devices. This request lead a few new
functions and the scripts mentioned previously.

<p>

With that version and beyond, you can add devices, graphs, and other things, in
an easily automated way. For all other interactions, you'll need to click your
way through the web interface. Removing devices, etc... click click click. If
you want to import or export graph, data, or host templates, you can do that
using the web interface, but only one template at a time.

<p>

There is a file called "api_automation_tools.php" (or the other api_xxxx.php scripts) 
in Cacti that sounds promising, but has no documentation. Many of the functions are self documenting by name or simplicity, but others are in great need of documenting and simplicity. Reading over the code, it's not obvious to me how I can do automated maintenance of cacti's devices, graphs, etc. Looking at Cacti's roadmap, I don't see 'improvements in automation' on it. Plugins are on the roadmap, but it's unclear if plugins will help with automation. There is an existing <a href="http://cactiusers.org/">plugin effort for Cacti</a>, but none of the plugins appear to aid with automation.

<p>

My guess is that the reason that the available automation is poorly documented
or doesn't exist is because of two reasons: first, that the developers didn't
develop cacti with systems administrator priorities in mind, and second, that
no one has made the feature request. The second point makes me wonder, is cacti
only used by people with a handful of systems to monitor? As I research Cacti,
it's starting to feel more and more like it isn't for people who want
automation or is mainly for those who have plenty of time to click few zillion
times keeping Cacti's information aligned with reality.

<p>

Automation should be accessible. It should be documented. If I can't find
Cacti's automation documentation, if it exists, then it's not accessible
automation. Yes, you could read the code and figure out exactly functions you
needed to call to modify or remove a device, graph, or whatever. Or skip the
code and look at the storage system to modify the configuration. Hacks produced
with this method are troublesome and will not scale. You will be lucky if the hacks
survive the upgrade to the  next version. Further, reading the code so you can
implement your own hacks is not accessible automation.

<p>

If an open source tool fits your needs but lacks automation, get involved in the community, if there is one. File bug reports and feature requests, or send patches if possible. If a commercial tool fits your needs but lacks automation, contact the vendor. Find out if they can implement what you need, and how long it might take. Don't get stuck with a tool that sucks away resources because the best maintenance interface is with the mouse and keyboard.

<p>

I'm not trying to pick on Cacti, specifically. Many software tools are simply
not written with accessible automation or other important sysadmin features in
mind. This is a very important feature to consider when looking for tools to
solve a problem, because, as I've repeated previously, automation saves you
time, effort, and errors.
