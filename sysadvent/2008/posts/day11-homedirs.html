Logging in to a machine that isn't your own workstation can be scary. You are
subject to the decisions made in someone else's configuration files that don't
always align with your own configurations: different shell, different default shell configuration, different default editor, different editor configuration, etc.

<p>

This is a scary and unproductive place. Suddenly 'ls' output is colored, or vim
uses a different indenting configuration, or worse, the default editor is not
your favorite editor (which doesn't have to be vim). Dedication to mastering
your basic tools over time has helped you create the One True Configuration for
each tool; deviation from this configuration means a loss of productivity. You
need to bring your home (directory) with you.

<p>

When your home directory doesn't magically appear through the miracles of
network filesystems, you may need to fix the problem another way. One potential
solution is to make sure that you copy all your configuration files (.vimrc,
.zshrc, whatever) to every host you're going to login to. This doesn't scale.
Further, it means everyone else has to repeat the same process for their own files.

<p>

The fix is to create a system which automatically keeps your home directory, on
every machine, populated with your configurations. You can do this minimally
with revision control and a cron job, but I prefer to add rsync to this
process.

<p>

Step one is make a place in your revision control system for people to create
home directories. For example, declaring that the path /trunk/home in your repository is
where you should dump your homedirectory contents. This means if my username
were 'jordan' then I'd check my '.vimrc' in as '/trunk/home/jordan/.vimrc' and
should expect it to show up on any system I have access to.

<p>

Step two is to pick a server that has access to both revision control and other
servers. Set up a cron job here that will check out and keep-updated your
entire /trunk/home path. Run an rsync daemon here that exports this /trunk/home
for other servers to update with. Set the rsync module name to 'homedirs' for
readability.

<p>

Step three is to deploy a cron job on every necessary server that copies down
all the obvious files from someserver::homedirs with rsync. You do have
automation that lets you install a cron job on all of your servers, right? ;)

<p>

Before you go and write the one line of rsync invocation that it would take to
copy someserver::homedirs to /home, you should take care to note the potential
security implications of doing this as root. If I have a file checked in called
/home/jls/test/shadow, and on one of the servers I sneakily symlink
/home/jls/test/ to /etc, and you run the rsync blindly as root, you just let me
overwrite your /etc/shadow file (or something else evil). Malicious or
accidental, doing a single rsync may not be the best solution.

<p>

The fix is to run the rsync as each user. You can get the list of users to copy
down by running 'rsync someserver::homedirs' to get the list of directories,
which should include your usernames. Check out the completed version of the
<a

home directories script</a>.

<p>

You should now be able to modify your home directory files in revision control
and have them automatically propogate without your assistance.
