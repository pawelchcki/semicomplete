Ganglia is a monitoring tool designed originally to help scalably monitor
computing grids and clusters. How can it help you, even if you don't run traditional computing grids or clusters?

<p>

Ganglia is an RRDtool-based (like Cacti) monitoring and graphing system.
Ganglia differs from Cacti in that configuration is much more automatic.
Ganglia's design centers around two programs: gmond and gmetad. The gmond
program listens for metric reports from other gmond programs (or tools that
emit the same messages).  The gmetad program periodically polls a single gmond
for data on an entire cluster. The trick, here, is that every time gmond gets
data, it sends that data via multicast to other gmonds, so every gmond has
state for the whole cluster. I presume that the actual gmond used by gmetad is
chosen at random, and if the chosen gmond host fails, another gmond host is
chosen.

<p>

In addition to clusters (one gmetad for N gmonds), Ganglia supports a higher
level collection they call a grid. A grid is automatically learned when you
have one gmetad polling from another gmetad. I am unaware if you can have more
than these levels (host, cluster, grid).

<p>

Multicast: This means your network gear will need multicast routing enabled if
you hope to span broadcast domains with this monitoring. Alternately, gmond can
be configured to send updates to a unicast address which can avoid needing
multicast routing and other potentially difficult network features.

<p>

Both gmond and gmetad have reasonably easy-to-use configuration files and come
with very reasonable default values. Simply running gmond and gmetad from the
default configurations will result in data you can access easily. The primary
Ganglia human interface is through a webserver.

<p>

Getting data out of Ganglia is easy. The historical data is stored in RRD files
 in a known location organized by cluster and hostname, so you can use your
 favorite rrdtool interface to query data. The current data is stored on any
 gmond which is queryable by connecting to  ganglia's xml port (default 8649). The service listening on that port will dump the metric data by cluster and host in XML.
 XML might make you groan, but it's use will help you write tools (like nagios checks)
to use the current data.

<p>

My first question after playing with Ganglia for a few minutes was, "How do I
monitor my network gear?" Typical network gear won't allow you to run arbitrary
binaries on them. Luckily, Ganglia comes with a tool for broadcasting metric
messages, gmetric. With gmetric, you can spoof the source of a piece of data
and easily claim that it came from your switch or router. This tool is also
the easiest way to extend the metrics ganglia monitors for you. For example:

<pre>
% gmetric -S "192.168.0.254:myrouter" -n uptime -v 3644 -t uint32 -u seconds
  spoofName: myrouter    spoofIP: 192.168.0.254 
</pre>

And the metric reported on the xml port is:
<pre>
&lt;HOST NAME="myrouter" IP="192.168.0.254" REPORTED="1229761211" TN="28" TMAX="20" DMAX="0" LOCATION="unspecified" GMOND_STARTED="0"&gt;
&lt;METRIC NAME="uptime" VAL="3644" TYPE="uint32" UNITS="seconds" TN="28" TMAX="60" DMAX="0" SLOPE="both" SOURCE="gmetric"/&gt;
&lt;/HOST&gt;
</pre>

You can also specify the lifetime of the value, which will cause it to
automatically be dropped from your gmond processes.

<p>

In addition to the gmetric command, there is are C and Python interfaces to
gmetric. Additionally, if you want your own software to emit gmetric messages,
there's an embedded gmetric library you can use.

<p>

My second question was, "What if a host is retired, is renamed, or is
reconfigured?" If a host never again reports data about itself, the last state
is still kept on every gmond and gmetad. To expire hosts that haven't spoken in
a while, you should set the <code>host_dmax</code> value in gmond.conf to some
value of seconds after which the host's state will be dropped. However, I am
not sure the RRDs for this host will be cleaned up automatically. Host renaming
probably requires that you rename the rrd directory holding the host's data if
you wish to maintain historical data across the rename. If you reconfigure a
host, deleting no-longer-used metric rrds is probably prudent. All of the above
changes will likely require walking around in the ganglia rrd storage directory
in your gmetad.

<p>

My last concern with ganglia was that the monitoring unit was a host. I
think most often in services, not hosts. Thankfully, there are workarounds.
Since you can spoof hostnames with gmetric, I decided to try something
not-hostname-like to identify a service+host combo. I tried to spoof
"service/hostname," but Ganglia uses this as the directory name and fails mkdir
for not doing it recursively.  Choosing another delimiter, comma, works fine:

<p>

<i> Note: <code>gmetric -S "foo/bar"</code> will succeed, but gmetad will crash
trying to write to that file path (mkdir not so smart). If you try this, you'll
have to stop all gmond and gmetad instances then start them all again to clear
the knowledge of the host named "foo/bar" </i>

<pre>
% gmetric -S "192.168.0.1:apache,aaa123" -n "apache errors" -v 5 -t uint32 -u "errors"
 spoofName: apache,aaa123    spoofIP: 192.168.0.1 
</pre>

However, it appears that ganglia keys on IP as unique, so trying to add another
entry of "192.168.0.1:mysql,aaa123" will appear in the web interface. Further
testing revealed that the IP portion of the spoof is not validated. If we use
the unique combination of "service,host" as both the IP and hostname,
everything is peachy:

<pre>
% gmetric -S "apache,aaa123:apache,aaa123" ...
% gmetric -S "mysql,aaa123:mysql,aaa123" ...
</pre>

Pushing only apache-related data to the 'apache' host prefixes will help you
organize your monitoring by service. This means you could easily view only
apache data for a host, etc. 

<p>

Ganglia makes me happy because I can worry only about giving it data. Adding a
new data source only requires knowing how to get the data and feed it
periodically to gmetric. After that, the data is automatically available in
Ganglia's web interface. I fed (with gmetric) some fake data about mysql 
connections to see what happens, and <a
href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dckv5f97_11cwhbrqdq">this was the
result</a>.-


<p>

The wish-list of Ganglia features includes a talk of making it easy to provide
custom graphs and views. Adding your own custom graphs requires, currently,
hacking on the php code that presents the web interface. Glancing at the PHP
powering the web interface doesn't make me cringe (easy to read!), so extending
ganglia by adding your own views is probably reasonable.

<p>

Considering what I've found so far with Ganglia, the shortcomings mentioned
here are easily worked around, and the potential benefits of
less-painfully-configured data trending and monitoring seem quite good.

<p>

Oh, by the way, gmond works in Windows. The project has a cygwin binary that
works by itself and can report data about a windows host. You can also use
gmetric from windows hosts to report info about themselves.
