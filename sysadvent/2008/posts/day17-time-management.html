During the holiday season there seems to be a mad rush between Thanksgiving and
Christmas.  An odd force compels us to hurry things up and get organized or
finish projects before the long Christmas break.  The great and glorious pay
off is a new January, fresh with possibility and reward.  Out with the old, in
with the new.

<p>

The new year offers something special and unique... perspective.  Maybe you
don't finish your projects prior to Christmas but things somehow feel different
in the new year.  New plans, new schedules, and a fresh perspective.  So how
can we get that perspective on a more regular basis?

<p>

<h4>Principles of Time Management</h4>

<ol>

<li> Write everything down:

<p>

Really, everything.  Work or home, write it all down.  If the thought cross
your mind, it should be recorded.  The thought may be "get mail", or "see new
Bond film", or "implement new backup solution".  If it's not written down you
will think about it again, and again, and again.  So get it out of your head.

<p>

I encourage you to set aside about 30 minutes to an hour for this purpose.  Set
aside some time, go to some place relaxing, get a cup of coffee and just let
your mind flow.  Things you always wanted to do as a kid.  A book, comic, or
movie you never really understood or only caught part of.  A hobby you've
always wanted to try.  A skill you think would be fun and useful.  A new
language you've wanted to learn (programming or spoken).  

<p>

In this alone you'll feel a great sense of relief and comfort.

</li>

<li> Keep it all in a central place:

<p>

I'll offer some systems below, but which system you use isn't as important as
simply consistantly using it.  For SysAdmin's this may actually be a small
collection of places, such as your company ticket system and a personal
planner.  If you simply use scraps of paper or a legal pad you'll innevitably
loose it, so opt for a specific peice of software or organizer or note book.
When your brain knows that all your projects and tasks are in a place it can
easily reference it will leave your concious mind alone.

</li>

<li> Keep multiple lists

<p>

You should not just have a single simple TODO list... life just isn't that
linear.  Rather, you should have a big "braindump" list of things to do, and
then break that out into daily, weekly, monthly lists, or whatever granularlity
you need.  

<p>

The sad fact is that in our minds, we tend to have a hodge-podge of TODO tasks,
large and small alike.  We constantly are steam-rolling this in our concious
mind, and eventually it becomes overwhelming.  When you lay everything out, and
then look at that list and say to yourself "What can I accomplish this month?",
then create that list, you start making life managable.  

<p>

This is key.  When you have everything written down, you can create smaller,
more approachable sublists to execute on it and have a greater sense of
confidence that you might actually do it.

</li>

<li> Create daily TODO lists:

<p>
Each day you should have a TODO list.  This is the end-result of your other
lists, which can actually be directly executed on.  Get mail, walk dog, buy
milk, install backup agents on systems 1-14, upgrade customerX's MySQL
instance, close at least 4 tickets.  These tasks need to be very granular...
do-able.  

<p>

When you have daily lists you have two big benefits.  Firstly, you have a
historical record of what you were doing day-by-day.  What were you trying to
get done on March 23rd?  Now you can look back and find out.  Secondly, you can
"push" tasks from one day to the next.  Don't have time to finish something
today?  Push it onto tomorows list now and move on with other
tasks you can complete.

<p>

This is something paper planners do very well, but is difficult to accomplish in software task managers.

</li>
<li> 'Clean the Garage' is a Project:

<p>

The key to using software management tools, such as 'Things' or 'OmniFocus', is
to think in projects.  A "project" is defined as any goal or objective that is
not accomplished in a single task.   As an example, replacing a lightbulb could
be either one.  If you have lightbulbs and you just need to swap it, its a
task.  However if your out of light bulbs and need to go to the store first, it
is now a project consisting of the tasks "Buy Lightbulbs" and "Replace bulb in
hallway".

<p>

I make special emphasis of this because if you don't think like this the
software tools will be very difficult to manage.  You'll just have growing
piles of TODO's that seem unrelated and you'll spend more time digging through
lists of tasks than accomplishing them.

</li>

<li> Think out the steps:

<p>

It's very important to not just think about the end result you want, such as
"Backup Oracle Database", but rather to think about its individual tasks and
then lay them out.  Even tasks that may be fairly simplistic can seem
overhwelmingly complex when you mind floods your concious with all the possible
permutations and unclear decisions you will need to make.  If you just break it
down you can stay more relaxed, focused, and objective.  You may even need to
create sub-projects to evaluate your options, such as "Benchmark RMAN",
"Evaluate BakBone Oracle Agent", etc.

<h4>Management Systems</h4>

<ol>
<li> Franklin Covey Paper Planners

<p>

Franklin Covey is a leading name in time management tools.  If you haven't
heard of them, think of the old "DayRunners" or other paper planners you've
seen, but more flexable and customized.

<p>

When you get started with Franklin Covey you will need to select and purchase a
binder, starter kit, and verious types of  filler pages.  If you visit a store
an employee will walk you through it, and if you visit their website there is a
guide.  Planners come in all sizes and styles to meet your needs directly.  I
personally prefer the smallest size, so that I can put it in a pocket.

<p>

The advantages to a paper planner is that you have a perminant record of each
days work and schedule to archive, its easy and fast to use, and you can take
it everywhere you go.  On the downside, its more expensive than software.
Expect a nice setup to run you about $80.

<p>

If you are on a budget, you can emulate the same thing in any cheap binder.
Many people use Moleskin notebooks for this purpose.

</li>
<li> OmniFocus

<p>

OmniFocus for the Mac is the most popular time management software around these
days.  Its very powerful but can take some time to learn.  Thankfully there are
some excellent tutorial videos and the online help is useful.  

<p>

The software lets you easily gather new tasks in an inbox and then later sort
them into categories and projects.  One of the most useful concepts in
OmniFocus is that of "Context".  Any particularelies on tagging tasks, which can allow you to organize more freely.  

<p>

I highly recommend that anyone considering the software route start with
OmniFocus's free trial.  Learn OmniFocus and then move to tools like Things.
If you don't and just try Things you'll immediately find it too free flow and
unhelpful.  

<p>

There is also an iPhone version of Things, however at last check it did not
support sync'ing with the desktop.
