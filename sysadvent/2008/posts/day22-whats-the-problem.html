From Wikipedia's <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Software_development_activities">software
development process</a> article, "the most important task in creating a
software product is extracting the requirements or requirements analysis."
Requirements analysis is an early part in the engineering process. This means
learning what problem needs to be solved and the parameters and constraints
with which you must solve them.

<p>

The wikipedia article goes on, "customers typically have an abstract idea of
what they want as an end result, but not what software should do." My
experience in systems administration is that customers may have an idea of what
they want as an end result, but they may not know what problem they are solving
and often present their idea in the form of a solution.

<p>

To describe this with an example, let's say you have a small team of sysadmins
who are familiar with mysql and your group supports a few mysql deployments in
your company.

<p>

A customer says, "I need postgresql installed." This is a request for action, not a description of the problem. You are only given the solution that the customer
believes will bring about
their desired end result. Do you simply install postgresql for them, or do you
ask why they need it? If you already have a well-supported mysql deployment,
you should be asking why you need to support another database.

<p>

Ask about the problem they need solved. Get details. Why does he or she need
postgres? Can the existing mysql deployment and knowledge be used instead? Most of the time customers who simply ask
for actions, "please implement this solution," often are unaware of existing,
similar options already available. It's also possible that this customer is
trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist, doesn't affect your company, or
isn't feasible to solve completely.

<p>

If you get requirements, you might find they are simply "I need a database that
speaks SQL." Alternately, you might find that the requirements include "I need
to run this 3rd party tool which requires postgres." Dig deeper. What does this
tool do? Can it's features be provided by another tool that doesn't require
burdening your team with additional products to support? Is the problem the
customer wants to solve even in the scope of your team?

<p>

In addition to getting the necessary information about the problem, you should
also make sure you are given other constraints and parameters. Is there a
deadline? What is the scope of the problem, who is affected, etc? What is the
priority?

<p>

Let's examine another common situation. Another customer says, "I need
apache on serverfoo restarted." Again, you should ask for a description of the problem. What are the symptoms the customer is observing? Restarting  apache is an action that could bring about a solution, but what are you
solving? What is broken? What if a customer reports "mail is down?" What does
"mail is down" mean? What are the symptoms being observed?

<p>

When digging for a description of the problem from your customer(s), be careful
to not offend the customer. It's easy to dismiss the customer as an idiot if
you the information you are given doesn't make sense or doesn't help you fix a
problem. This issue can easily occur when a non-domain-expert interacts with a
domain expert. Remember that perspective is reality, and that "mail is down"
makes total sense to your customer but is confusing to you. Make sure your
fellow sysadmins follow the advice in this paragraph, too.

<p>

Asking for requirements can be a tool to help push back on bad ideas.
Sometimes a management hammer comes down from above and says you must implement
something that you disagree with or don't understand. Being a domain expert,
you might be disagreeing or lacking understanding because the request doesn't
make sense. Ask for requirements! Sometimes ideas manifest themselves into
requests (or mandates) without the idea being actually thought out. 

<p>

Lastly, always remember you can say, "no." Not every idea is a good one. Bad
ideas can come with urgency. Be understanding of any urgency from your
customers, but remember that you have the most information about what makes a
change bad. Otherwise, why would they be asking you or your team to do it?
Be aware of things people will say to convince you to do something even though
you can show it is incorrect, such as "the CEO said we have to do this." Facts are
your ally, so use facts to show why a proposal is wrong or why the
requirements are impossible to fulfill.
