question multiple times since sysadvent began. </i>

<p>

Capistrano or Puppet? Both.

<p>

Puppet provides you with a way to specify a state your system should be in.
Puppet's features will help you keep a machine in the same state. If someone
hand-edits an apache config, you can have puppet automatically replace it with
the correct one and reload apache, for example. Puppet runs on each of your
servers.

<p>

Capistrano lets you describe what to do to a system or set of systems: Upload a
file, run a program, restart a service, etc. Capistrano runs from your
workstation and does work for you on remote systems.

<p>

So, why both?

<p>

Puppet needs a source of state information, and that
source  has to come from somewhere. If you always run on the bleeding edge of
your configurations, you can feed the puppet master with your revision control
system and use the state described in the head revision. Bleeding edges tend to
be bloody for a reason. You could feed puppet with data from a branch of your
revision control, too, and both not need capistrano for the feeding and not run
on the head revision. You could deploy new state to puppet with Capistrano on a
planned release schedule.

<p>

Puppet lets you specify that the 'httpd' package should be installed, and even what version. If you maintain your own package repository, you can
control what version is installed (which you should). To upgrade the 'httpd'
package, you could use Capistrano to upload new packages to your package
repository and to deploy puppet manifests to keep 'httpd' automatically updated to whatever
version you decide.

<p>

As an example, here's how the state management with puppet and capistrano might look for your apache configuration:
<ol>
  <li> Modify httpd.conf in revision control, check it in. </li>
  <li> Use capistrano to push the new state to your puppet masters. </li>
  <li> Puppet will see the new state and apply necessary changes. [*] </li>
</ol>

[*] This will only occur automatically if you run puppet periodically (like
through cron) rather than manually.

<p>

If the change was bad, you can revert the change in revision control and again
use capistrano to push the new files.

<p>

You can use puppet and capistrano to do similar tasks, if you wish, but I find
they are best suited to compliment each other. Let puppet focus on automated
state maintenance and let capistrano help you do deployments of new packages
and new configurations.
