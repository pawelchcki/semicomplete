A <a href="/2008/12/day-7-host-vs-service.html">few days ago</a> we covered
using a yaml file to label machines based on desired configuration. Sometimes
part of this desired configuration includes using a config file that needs
modification based on attributes of the machine it is running on: labels,
hostname, ip, etc.

<p>

Using the same idea presented in Day 7, what can we do about generating
configuration files? Your 'mysql-slave' label could cause your my.cnf (mysql's
config file) to include settings that enable slaving off of a master mysql
server. You could also use this machine:labels mapping to automatically
generate monitoring configurations for whatever tool you use; nagios, cacti,
etc.

<p>

The older ways of doing config generation included using tools like sed, m4,
and others, to modify a base configuration file inline or writing a script that
had lots of print statements to generate your config. These are both bad with
respect to present-day technology: templating systems. Most (all?) major
language have templating systems: ruby, python, perl, C, etc. I'll limit
today's coverage, for the sake of providing an example, to ruby and ERB.

<p>

ERB is a ruby templating tool that supports conditionals, in-line code, in-line
variable expansion, and 
other things you'll find in other systems. It gets bonus points because it comes standard with ruby installations. That one bonus means that most people (using ruby) will use ERB as their templating tool (Ruby on Rails does, for example), and this manifests itself in the form of good documentation and examples.

<p>

Let's generate a sample nagios config using ruby, ERB and yaml. Before that, we'll need another yaml file to describe what checks are run for each label. After
all, the 'frontend' label might include checks for process status, page fetch
tests, etc, and we don't want a single 'check-frontend' check since mashing all
checks into a single script can mask problems.

<p>

You can view the 
<a href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/svn/sysadvent/2008/day10/hostlabels.yaml">hostlabels.yaml</a>
and 
<a href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/svn/sysadvent/2008/day10/labelchecks.yaml">lablechecks.yaml</a>
to get an idea of the simple formatting. Using this data we can see that
'host2.prod.yourdomain' has the 'frontend' label and should be monitored using
the 'check-apache' and 'check-frontend-page-test' checks.

<p>

The ruby code and ERB are about 70 lines total, perhaps too much to write here,
so here are the files:

<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/svn/sysadvent/2008/day10/configgen.rb">configgen.rb</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/svn/sysadvent/2008/day10/nagios.cfg.erb">nagios.cfg.erb</a> </li>
</ul>

Running 'configgen.rb' with all the files above in the same directory produces
<a
href="http://semicomplete.googlecode.com/svn/sysadvent/2008/day10/OUTPUT">this
output</a>. Here's a small piece of it:

<pre>
define hostgroup {
  hostgroup_name frontend
  members host2.prod.yourdomain
}

define service {
  hostgroup_name frontend
  service_description frontend.check-http-getroot
  check_command check-http-getroot
}

define service {
  hostgroup_name frontend
  service_description frontend.check-https-certificate-age
  check_command check-https-certificate-age
}

define service {
  hostgroup_name frontend
  service_description frontend.check-https-getroot
  check_command check-https-getroot
}
</pre>

I'm not totally certain this generates valid nagios configurations, but I did
my best to make it close. 

<p>

If you add a new 'frontend' server to hostlabels.yaml, you can regenerate the nagios config trivially and see that the 'frontend' hostgroup now contains a new host:

<pre>
define hostgroup {
  hostgroup_name frontend
  members host3.prod.yourdomain, host2.prod.yourdomain
}
</pre>

(There's also a new host {} block declaring the new host3.prod.yourdomain not shown in this post)

<p>

Automatically generating config files moves you into a whole new world of
sysadmin zen. You can regenerate any configuration file if it is corrupt or lost.
No domain knowledge is required to add a new host or label. Knowing the nagios (or other
tools) config language is only required when modifying the config template, not
the label or host definitions (a time/mistake saver). You could swap nagios out
for another monitoring tool and still make sure the underlying concepts
(frontend has http monitoring, etc) are consistent. Being able to automatically
generate configs means that you probably have both the templates and the source
data (our yaml files here) stored in revision control, which is a whole other
best practice to focus on.
