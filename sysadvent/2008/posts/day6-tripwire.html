We need more automation-minded people writing tools. While playing with tripwire today, I saw
something that made me think, how am I supposed to automate this? I don't like feeling like a useful tool can't be automated, so let's figure out how.

<p>

I'd done the basics using tripwire, so far. Creating site and host keys,
creating the encrypted config and policy files, and running 'tripwire --init'
to get things started. After making some changes, I ran 'tripwire --check' to
see what tripwire would tell me. Things were going good until I decided to
update tripwire's idea of what the current system should be, with 'tripwire
--update'

<p>

The <a href="http://linuxgazette.net/106/odonovan.html">tripwire guide</a> I
was following told me what would happen, but I hadn't read that far. Tripwire launched vi and let me edit a document that started like this:

<pre>
Tripwire(R) 2.3.0 Integrity Check Report

Report generated by:          root
Report created on:            Fri Dec  5 19:11:39 2008
Database last updated on:     Never
</pre>

The document was full of information about what had changed on the system. 
I hadn't a clue what I was supposed to do, since I was only skimming
documentation when I got stuck or confused, so I went back to the guide and saw:

<blockquote>
"If any changes are found you will be presented with a "ballot-box" styled form that must be completed by placing an 'x' opposite the violations that are safe to be updated in the database."
<br>
<i>(link to the guide this quote came from under further reading)</i>
</blockquote>

I have to what? Carefully hand-edit some generated output, so tripwire will know
what to store back in it's truth database? How the heck do you automate this? Was 
this a design decision meaning automation and security were mutually exclusive? 
I don't think they're mutually exclusive.

<p>

The tripwire config you used when you ran 'tripwire --init' had a variable in it,
"EDITOR." This was set to /usr/bin/vi. I changed it to '/bin/cat' and
regenerated (tripwire --create-cfgfile) the encrypted config file and reran the
update command, and instead of launching vi, the data was simply output to
stdout, meaning we might be able to automate it, replacing cat with some smart script.

<p>

The data format in the file report is very clearly meant for human reading, not
for computer parsing. Tripwire can parse it for its own purposes, but are you
up to writing a parser? Googling for <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=tripwire+report+parser">tripwire report
parser</a> doesn't show promise. 

<p>

I replaced /usr/bin/nano with a shell script to see what output I should expect. Rerunning 'tripwire --check' and then 'tripwire --update', my nano change shows up like this:

<pre>
[x] "/usr/bin/nano"
</pre>

Leaving that box checked would mean "I know nano changed, it's ok." Writing a
handler that automatically decided whether file was knowingly modified might be
simple. For example, if you upgraded a package recently, most/all of the files
for that package will be reported as modified/added/removed. You might be able
to ask your packaging system if a file is valid. For instance, if a file is
listed as modified, and you use RPMs, you could see if the file has changed
since installing the RPM:

<pre>
% rpm -Vf /usr/bin/nano
S.5....T    /usr/bin/nano
</pre>

According to rpm's manpage, the first column means that the size, md5, and
modifciation time are different on the current nano than the one that was
installed by the rpm.

<p>

I'd hate to have to answer these questions every time I did an upgrade on one
of my servers. Doing it once would be annoying, but doing it across all of my
servers after an upgrade (how many servers would that be for you?) would be an
impossible nightmare. 

<p>

Since tripwire is a useful tool, you could use the verification information from rpm
to automatically answer tripwire's inquiry with a script set as your EDITOR config variable. If you're especially on-top of your sysadmin practices, your systems have automated software rollouts, and if you want to use tripwire, you'll need to automate the management process.
