Maybe you're a windows sysadmin. Maybe you're not. Either way, you might find
the features in Powershell pretty cool.

<p>

Powershell is Windows-only and free to use. Some syntactic differences asside, it 
looks and feels like a unix shell language. It has standard features you might expect
such as functions, recursion, variables, variable scope, objects, and a handful
of built-in functionality to help you get work done, but it does many things better.

<p>

In addition to these baseline expectations, functions in powershell trivially take
flag arguments by simply declaring a function argument (<code>function
foo($bar) { ... }</code> can be invoked as <code>foo -bar "somevalue"</code>.
You can create arbitrary objects with properties and methods defined on the
fly. Exception handling, logging, trace debugging, and other goodies are packed
in by default.

<p>

It supports pipes like your favorite unix shell, except instead of piping text,
you pipe objects. The key word is object. When you run 'dir' (or ls, which is
an alias), it outputs file objects. When you run 'ps' (which is an alias of
get-process), you get process objects. When you run 'get-content' a file, you
get an array of strings.

<p>

Why is this significant? As a unix sysadmin, you quickly become intimate with
piping one command to another, smoothly sandwiching filter invocations between
others tools. Filter tools like awk, sed, grep, xargs, etc, all helping you
convert one output text into another input text for another command. What if
you didn't have to do that, or had to do it less? No more parsing the output of
ls(1), stat(1), or du(1) to ask for file attributes when powershell's file
object has them. What about getting process attributes?

'select' is an alias for 'select-object' which lets you (among other things)
trim an object to only selected properties. Inspection is done with
'get-member' (or 'gm' for short) and you can inspect objects output by 'ls' by
doing: <code>ls | gm</code>, or processes with <code>get-process | gm</code>. You can ask an object what type it is with <code>obj.gettype()</code>; such as <code>(get-item .).gettype()</code>

<p>

But what if you want to manipulate the registry easily?  The registry,
filesystem, aliases, variables, environment, functions, and more are all
considered "providers" in Powershell. Each provider gives you access to a
certain data store using standard built-in commands. A provider can be invoked
by prefixing a path with the provider name. For example, to access a registry
key, you could use <code>dir Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code> to list keys
in that part of the registry.

<p>

In addition to other neat features, you've got nice access to both COM and
.NET. Want to create a tempfile? 

<pre>
PS > $tmp = [System.IO.Path]::GetTempFileName()
PS > ls $tmp
    Directory: Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\Users\Jordan\AppData\Local\Temp

Mode                LastWriteTime     Length Name
----                -------------     ------ ----
-a---         12/2/2008   1:25 AM          0 tmp55FC.tmp

PS > rm $tmp
</pre>

<p>

Help is also conveniently available from the powershell prompt. Help, which can
be accessed with a muscle-memory-friendly 'man,' comes in different details
levels. Try <code>help select-object</code> and then <code>help select-object
-detailed</code>. There's also other useful builtins like foreach-object (like
'for' in bourne), select-object (like cut, tail, head, and uniq, but cooler) ,
sort-object (like sort, but cooler), where-object (like grep, but cooler),
measure-object (like wc, but cooler), and format-list and format-table for
sanely printing object properties.

Are you still scripting in DOS batch or VBScript? Do you use Cygwin as a means
of escaping to a scripting language on windows that is less frustrating or
awkward? Are you suddenly facing windows administration when your background is
unix? Check out Powershell.
