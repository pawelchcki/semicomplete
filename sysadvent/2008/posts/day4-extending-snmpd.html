Do you monitor your hosts with snmp? Ever wanted to add additional data sources
to your snmp agent? Net-SNMP's snmpd lets you do this.

<p>

There are a few different options available to extend snmpd. The first is the
most primitive, simply running a program and reporting the first line of output
and the exit status. This is done with the 'exec' statement in snmpd.conf.

<pre>
# Format is
# exec &lt;name&gt; &lt;command&gt; [args]
exec googleping /bin/ping -c 1 -w 1 -q
</pre>

You need to specify the full path for 'exec' commands. If you want to run your command in /bin/sh, swap in 'sh' for 'exec' and you get to avoid the full path requirement. The 'exec' and 'sh' extensions command show results through the UCD-SNMP-MIB::extTable table:

<pre>
% snmpwalk -v2c -c secret localhost UCD-SNMP-MIB::extTable
UCD-SNMP-MIB::extIndex.1 = INTEGER: 1
UCD-SNMP-MIB::extNames.1 = STRING: googleping
UCD-SNMP-MIB::extCommand.1 = STRING: /bin/ping
UCD-SNMP-MIB::extResult.1 = INTEGER: 0
UCD-SNMP-MIB::extOutput.1 = STRING: PING www.l.google.com (74.125.19.147) 56(84) bytes of data.
UCD-SNMP-MIB::extErrFix.1 = INTEGER: noError(0)
UCD-SNMP-MIB::extErrFixCmd.1 = STRING: 
</pre>

You can see that the first line of output is available in extOutput. This is
nice, but the order of commands depends entirely on the order in snmpd.conf, so
if you put another 'exec' above the googleping one, the googleping check
becomes .2 instead of .1, which is not so stable with respect to adding new
exec statements or moving them around. Boo.

<p>

The second option available is called 'extend,' and it works similarly to
'exec,' but better. The 'extend' configuration accepts multiline output from
your command and is indexed on the name (ie; "googleping") instead of an index
number (ie; 1, 2, etc). Just change 'exec' to 'extend':

<pre>
extend googleping /bin/ping -c 1 -w 1 -qn www.google.com
extend mysqlstatus /usr/bin/mysqladmin status
</pre>

These 'extend' commands show up in NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsExtensions. If you
only want the output, you can walk NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendOutput1Table
(or nsExtendOutput2Table). If you want only the exit code, you can walk
nsExtendResult. If you want to view the output of walking nsExtensions (it's too long to post here), <a

<p>

Remember the benefit of 'extend' over 'exec' was that the indexing was on the
name, so let's query for only the googleping result:

<pre>
% snmpget -v2c -c secret localhost 'NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendResult."googleping"' 
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendResult."googleping" = INTEGER: 0

# If I null route all www.google.com IPs, and requery:
% snmpget -v2c -c secret localhost 'NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendResult."googleping"' 
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendResult."googleping" = INTEGER: 2
</pre>

Take note above that the OID is in single quotes and "googleping" still needs
to be sent as quoted to snmpget, this is so snmpget understands that this is
really an octet-string OID. (See what "googleping" becomes with snmpget -On)

<p>

The output and exit code of your 'extend' and 'exec' statements are cached for a short period of time. The exact time saved in cache is determined by the nsExtendCacheTime OID. If you have write access configured in snmp, you can issue a SET command to change the cache time.

<pre>
# Cache the googleping results for 15 seconds
% snmpset -v2c -c secret localhost 'NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendCacheTime."googleping"' i 15
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendCacheTime."googleping" = INTEGER: 15

% snmpwalk -v2c -c secret localhost NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendCacheTime
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendCacheTime."googleping" = INTEGER: 15
NET-SNMP-EXTEND-MIB::nsExtendCacheTime."mysqlstatus" = INTEGER: 5
</pre>

Lastly, you can tell snmpd to 'pass' (that's the name of the config statement)
handling of an entire OID subtree to an external program, which seems like a
nice feature. This lets you write a subtree handler in your language of choice
rather than being required (while still an option) to write your more complex
handlers using snmpd's perl support or C module support. For brevity, I'll skip
coverage of that, but it works similar to 'extend' and 'exec,' but has it's own
(simple) text protocol for telling your subprocess what OID it wants data on
(See further reading).

<p>

Extending SNMP to support your own data sources is a good way to allow your
existing monitoring tools (nagios, etc) to monitor remotely without having to
have local access such as with ssh or nrpe.
