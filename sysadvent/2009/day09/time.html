What Time Is It?

<p>
Time is relative. No, I'm not talking about Einstein's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity">relativity theory</a>. 
</p>

Time is a complex thing. Did you know there are a few bazillion <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_standard">time standards</a>?  Not
time representations, but actually standards on how to record and observe the
passage of time! That's awesome! Further, learning about time standards helps explain why we have leap years and leap seconds.

<p>

Why do we care about time? Before we talk about why, let's first introduce some
time representation formats.

<p>

Time formats for exchange and storage are also complex. <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> is a widely used
and abused time format standard. This standard also supports durations (aka 30
seconds) and intervals (start and end timestamps), though I've never seen
anything use ISO 8601 durations or intervals. Timestamps (ie; a point in time)
are the focus of today, so we'll ignore durations and intervals. The problem
with ISO 8601 is that it is huge and complex and supports a pile of different
timestamp representations with all kinds of optional fields. This complexity
has lead groups like the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">W3C</a>
and <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt">IETF</a> to publish time
format specifications that are similar to ISO 8601, but much simpler and
reduced.

<p>

An example RFC 3339 timestamp looks like:
<code>2009-12-09T00:45:58-08:00</code> (see RFC 3339 section 5.6). Like ISO
8601, RFC 3339 supports fractional seconds, so the following is also valid:
<code>2009-12-09T00:45:58<b>.335134</b>-08:00</code>.

<p>

The RFC does not specify a limit to the precision of the fractional seconds.
This fractional seconds field is also the only optional field in RFC 3339; all
other values must be present.

<p>

Another common time format is <a
  href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt">RFC-2822</a> (supercedes <a
  href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822">RFC-822</a>). RFC-2822 section 3.3
covers time formats. This format has redundant fields and generally appears to
be a format for the benefit of humans, not computers. It appears to be
backwards compatible with RFC 822 time format. Mentionables about this format
are that it uses abbreviated english names for months, does not support
fractional seconds, and has some oddities in whitespace suggestions.

<p>

Text time formats aren't the only ones you need to be aware of. MySQL supports
three time types, none of them superb. None of MySQL's time types support
fractional seconds.  DATETIME and TIMESTAMP lack timezone storage. DATE doesn't
hold times. TIME doesn't hold dates. 
is funky at best. TIMESTAMP will convert to UTC on write and
back to local time on read, but the mysql client needs to explain it's view of
<a
  href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/time-zone-support.html">timezones
  external to any read or write</a>. <a
  href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/time-zone-leap-seconds.html">MySQL's
  leap second support</a> is odd - you won't be able to detect if a stored
timestamp is during a leapsecond due to a bug they had to work around in their
mysql dump/restore with leap seconds.

<p>

Like the MySQL example there are thousands of cases of software not using
standard time formats. Almost every piece of software uses it's own logging
time format, which brings me to my next point -

<p>

Time formats are a perfect example of what the programming world would say is
mixing your data model and your view on that data. In this case, our data model
is time, and the view is whatever format present it in. For example, in syslog,
you'll see times like "Dec 6 11:51:04" and in Apache you'll see
"02/Oct/2009:12:01:16 -0700".  Nagios uses "[1253586479]" which is unix epoch.

<p>

Any random time format, depending on what it is needed for, can have
one of a few problems. Time formats often omit values: syslog doesn't often
have year or timezone. Most time formats don't sort when compared: apache logs
do not sort because the month is specified as english abbreviation, 'Dec' for
example). Finally, few things support or bother to use fractional seconds.
Fractional seconds (micro/milli/nanoseconds) is not required for most
applications, but it's something to be mindful of.

<p>

A lack of common time format means that you can pick any two pieces of software
in your system and have a high probability that they don't speak the same time
format. This makes it very difficult to compare times across applications
without writing custom conversions (with awk, perl, whatever) to normalize all
the times to a single format for comparison. This sucks.

<p>

All of the above make real the following - having two tools speak different
time languages makes for a hard time.  I am quite annoyed that most software
chooses to use their own randomly-created time format. You should be annoyed,
too. 

<p>

Stepping back from the time format problems discussion, software time formats
aren't the only problem. Having the same tool on two servers speak the same
time format but out of sync can cause other problems for you. Some protocols
require time to be synchronized. 
<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Kerberos-Infrastructure-HOWTO/time-sync.html">Kerberos</a>
is an example system that requires time synchronization. 

<p>

Use NTP to synchronize clocks across your servers.

<p>

As discussed above, lots of time formats do not include time zones. For your
own sanity, you should standardize on a single time zone. UTC is a good choice,
as it does not use daylight savings time. If you are bad at converting UTC to
localtime in your head, buy two wall clocks for your office and set one to UTC
and one to local. Where applications allow, have them always show time in
localtime but store time in UTC.

<p>

Lastly, be careful when you change the system time zone (on any operating
system). Some processes don't check the timezone changes. For example, apache
will continue to log in PST (-0800) even after you change /etc/localtime to use
UTC - fixing this requires a restart of apache. The same problem may plague
your cron, syslog, and other systems, depending on how they are implemented.

<p>

Time is hard. Keep your server and device time in sync, try to keep your software
using the same time format, use a common time zone across your systems, and if
you have the option, use time formats that don't drop things like year. These
practices should help you and others navigate through time.
