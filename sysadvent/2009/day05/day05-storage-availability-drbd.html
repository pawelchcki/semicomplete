Storage and storage technologies have really moved into the limelight in
recent years.  Previously, advanced storage and storage concepts were hidden
away in large corporate datacenters; they were complicated, proprietary, and
costly. Most small and mid-sized organizations used or still use systems with
local or direct attached hard drives.  In the event of drive failure, RAID was
relied upon as the sole savior to keep things running uninterrupted.  In the
event of array or system loss, restore from backups was the primary or only
option. The drives were expensive and storage needs modest (arguably due to
storage costs).
</p>

<p>
Move forward a few years to the now. Storage needs are, relatively speaking,
monumental, and space is much less costly. Virtualization has come to the
forefront, and you are now behind the proverbial technology curve if not taking
advantage of its benefits. System densities have increased (blades,
virtualization, etc) and now, more than ever, storage is a critical component
of the infrastructure.  Most of these density-increasing technologies that
improve space, power consumption, cooling, management, disaster recovery, and
availability, require carefully designed, reliable, and centralized storage.
Reliable storage starts with good drives and controllers with appropriate RAID
levels for the application as well as connectivity to that storage. What
happens when a controller fails, or a multiple drive failure brings down a RAID
set, or connectivity is lost?  The proprietary solutions of course have their
options and some very nice options indeed, but for some organizations that
need storage availability, many of the proprietary solutions do not scale to
the available budgets.  </p>

This is where <a href="http://drbd.org/">DRBD</a> comes to the table.  DRBD is
graciously maintained, supported, and provided as
<a href="http://www.drbd.org/home/drbd-is-gpled/">open source</a>  by
the people over at <a href="http://www.linbit.com/en/">Linbit</a>.  As the
website states: "DRBD can be understood as network based raid-1".  Technically
speaking, DRBD is a block device driver you layer into the device chain just
like <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_(Linux)">LVM</a> or
<a
href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/linux-raid">MD</a>.
It can be put anywhere in the stack: on top of the disk device, on top of LVM
or MD, at the top just under the file-system, wherever it makes sense.  Its
specialty is taking block level changes, keeping track of them, and sending
them over a network to another system where they are duplicated.  DRBD has a
few specific traits to highlight. First off, it is smart (and dumb?). It works
at the block level and knows which bits may be out of sync and will only send
those bits across the wire. It knows nothing of file-systems, files, etc, so the
application using it can be anything: samba, iSCSI, NFS, EXT3, XFS, or
others. Secondly it can be non-destructively added to existing data volumes. It
is not necessary to go through backup/install/restore process - only install,
configure and replicate.  </p>

<p>
Linbit also offers a closed source product, <a
href="http://www.linbit.com/en/products-services/drbd-proxy/">DRBD Proxy</a>,
that is designed for long haul, high latency(200ms) connections as well as
greater than 2-node replication situations. If you want to replicate outside
of a LAN using DRBD, then you'll need it.
<a href="http://blogs.linbit.com/florian/2009/11/16/linbit-announces-stewardship-for-heartbeat-code-base/">Recently</a>,
Linbit
became the steward of the <a href="http://linux-ha.org/">Heartbeat</a> cluster
messaging codebase.  Heartbeat is the application that handles the
monitoring and fail-over activities between the systems.  DRBD and Heartbeat
are a tried and true tag team for storage high availability / fail-over
situations.
</p>

<p>
So what does a simple, highly available, solution look like?  Two nodes with
appropriate storage use DRBD in their block device stacks to replicated the
data over a gigabit or better connection; one is primary (the source), the
other secondary (the destination).  Heartbeat runs on both systems
monitoring for system and service availability.  If Heartbeat detects a
failure it coordinates the startup of services on the backup node including
all DRBD and service (could be nfs, samba, iscsi, etc) related commands.  It
is a beautiful thing to see in action.
</p>

<p>
I'm not one to rehash out the commands needed to install, configure
and run these solutions.  The DRBD website has an excellent
<a href="http://www.drbd.org/docs/about/">user manual</a> that would be absolutely
futile to reproduce here, and Heartbeat is relatively simplistic to get
established and working.  Both products have a multitude of options not
necessary for basic operations but are very handy for more fine grained control
and tuning.  </p>

<p>
What are the keys parts to a good solution?  DRBD relies on TCP/IP
networking to move data around.  Make sure gigabit or better is being used
along with quality cables and switching.  If at all possible keep DRBD
traffic on its own network - or even direct cross-over connections.  Don't
skimp on your backup node.  A backup node that can not keep up with
replication will cause IO blocking on the primary.  Design connectivity to
handle loss of a switch.  If in doubt - ask Linbit or the community for
assistance.  DRBD, DRBD+Heartbeat have been in use for a while and they are
sound technologies.
