Active Directory naming is easy, right?

Active Directory naming is easy, right? You've just got to pick a name
for your domain; any name will do won't it?
</p>

<p>
This is the view many newcomers to Active Directory (AD) take, and it's the
view I had when I was first introduced to AD. It often works, even for a while.
Then, a few days or weeks down the line, you start to notice problems, or with
greater understanding of how AD works, you realise that perhaps there was a
better name. By this time, it is too late - the name is set in stone. Sure, you
could rename it with the domain name rename tool (rendom), but it's likely to
cause problems. Let's look at why AD naming can be problematic and what we can
do to make things better. 
</p>

<p>
Microsoft's decision to tie Active Directory closely to DNS, while making
sense, has caused a lot of problems for inexperienced sysadmins. One of the
most common problems I hear from new sysadmins working with AD for the first
time is, "I setup Active Directory with our company's external domain name, but
now no-one can get to the company website or ftp site!" 
</p>

<p>
Why does this happen?  If your AD domain is <code>example.com</code>, AD will
answer DNS queries for that domain, which likely fails to serve external
services properly, such as your corp website at <code>www.example.com</code>.
</p>

<p>
Using your company's external domain name for DNS seems like the perfect idea
at first. Limited understanding of how AD interacts with DNS has lead to a
decision that may create problems and administrative overhead.
Yes, there are potential solutions to this problem: implementing split brain
(aka split view) DNS, changing your AD name, or installing IIS on every domain
controller to perform redirects. But it's a scary prospect for a new sysadmin
who's boss is about to explode because he can't get to their website and is
often enough to put them off AD for good. So yes, you can use your external
domain name for AD, but in my opinion, you shouldn't.  It causes problems, so
why give yourself the headache?
</p>

<p>
I've found there are a number of excuses people give for using the external
domain name for AD, and I've used some of them myself. For example,
"We had to use our external domain because we want to use that domain name for
our UPN suffix". Truthfully, you can have as many UPN suffixes as
you like by adding them in the <a
  href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc770299.aspx">Domains and
  Trusts</a> MMC. Inexperience with AD may drive assumptions as above, but
after digging into it, you will find that your assumptions may not be correct
about what you think you need to use as your AD domain.
</p>

<p> So, what AD domain name should we use? There are two common schools of
thought on this subject: either something like <code>example.local</code>, or
use a subdomain of your external domain (like <code>corp.example.com</code>,
if you own <code>example.com</code>).  Alternately, you can use a different
external domain name, but this is not recommended for the general case. </p>

<p> The use of the <code>.local</code> extension came about because it allowed
the separation of the AD domain from the registered internet domain (ie;
<code>example.com</code>) without having to buy another domain. It's also easy
to get an SSL certificate for a <code>.local</code> domain from a trusted SSL
vendor, should you need one for internal resources. The alternative is to chose
a real, unowned TLD to build your domain on, but you have the obvious risk of
that domain being owned by someone else. </p>

<p> Maybe we have a good domain decision, now, with no extra cost?  Maybe not!
There are problems with using the <code>.local</code> domain. First,
it's not a reserved TLD. While it's unlikely, it's possible that <a
  href="http://www.iana.org/">IANA</a> could choose to delegate this TLD,
opening it up for registration and causing potential name conflicts.  Second,
the use of <code>.local</code> can also cause problems if you have Apple
computers on the network, as it is used by the Bonjour service. Finally,
because <code>.local</code> domains are not controlled by a registrar, someone
else could be using the same domain name in another AD instance. This problem
will bite you when you need to establish trusts or merge domains with another
AD instance - if both of you are using <code>example.local</code> you will have
conflicts. </p>

<p> Despite these problems, the use of <code>.local</code> is still popular
especially in small companies. Microsoft's Small Business server even suggests
using this when using its configuration wizard to create an AD domain.  </p>

<p> Besides naming with <code>.local</code>, you could choose the name as a
subdomain of your external domain, such as <code>ad.example.com</code>, or buy
an additional domain for AD only, such as <code>examplecorp.com</code>. Using
something like <code>ad.example.com</code> or <code>corp.example.com</code> is
pretty common today; Microsoft also recommends this. This is easy and ensures
ownership of that domain (unless you forget to renew <code>example.com</code>).
Using this method means that your AD DNS server is only responsible for this
subdomain and will happily forward on requests for your external websites to
servers.
</p>

<p> AD naming seems easy, but as we've shown above, there are important
considerations when choosing a domain name for your Active Directory domain.
This advice, "be careful about seemingly-simple decisions," carries to many other
spaces than AD.</p>

<p> Setting up an AD infrastructure should be planned carefully. The domain
name choice should be a part of this planning. Consider how your network will
be used, and how it will grow over time. If you don't own a public domain name,
is it worth purchasing one now so you can ensure your AD domain name is
reserved, even if you never use it on the internet. If you do have an external
domain name already, try and keep your internal and external DNS separate,
you'll appreciate it in the long run. Finally, never use a public domain name
that you don't own, you never know who might snap it up and cause you problems!
