Hudson is a job monitor. It is primarily used as a build server for doing <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous
builds</a>, testing, and other build engineering activities. Continuous build
and integration is a useful tool in improving the day-to-day quality of your
company's code.

<p>

My first week's impression of <a
  href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Meet+Hudson">Hudson</a> was
that it is really great software. Things work the way I expect! It has good
documentation and a good web interface. The APIs are easy to use. Compared to
other learning curves, Hudson's was extremely short thanks to one part
documentation and one part ease of use. I had some internal software building
in hudson in only a few minutes of playing with the tool.

<p>

Setting up a new job in Hudson is really easy, and every field in the job
configuration interface has a little question mark icon that reveals useful
documentation when clicked. It does the build-related things I expect: build on
demand, build if there's been new commits, emailing folks who break things,
give me trending on build statuses, etc.

<p>

Getting a bit more advanced into Hudson beyond simply building stuff or running
jobs, let's talk administrative tasks. Speaking of administrative tasks, Hudson
has <a
  href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Administering+Hudson">administrative
  documentation</a> detailing how to backup and restore Hudson configurations,
renaming jobs, etc. Hudson's configuration is stored in XML files in a sane
directory heirarchy that makes it easy to backup specific jobs or specific
configurations.

<p>

Hudson also has an <a
  href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Remote+access+API">API</a>.
The things you need to know about the API is that any url you visit on the web
interface can be accessed with the API. Adding '/api/' to any url will give you
the API documentation for that url - only one thing to remember when asking
"what's the API for this page?" - totally awesome.

I wanted to take the latest successful build of a specific job and put the
resulting files (artifacts) into my local yum repo. Artifacts are what Hudson
calls the files you archive after a build is complete.  Fetching the artifacts
from the latest successful build of any given job is fairly
straightforward. The XML api makes this easy, allowing you to find the
artifacts for your builds:

<pre>
% GET http://build/hudson/job/helloworld/lastSuccessfulBuild/api/xml
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;freeStyleBuild&gt;
  ...
  &lt;artifact&gt;
    &lt;displayPath&gt;rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/helloworld-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm&lt;/displayPath>
    &lt;fileName&gt;helloworld-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm&lt;/fileName>
    <b>&lt;relativePath&gt;deploy/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/helloworld-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm&lt;/relativePath></b>
  &lt;/artifact&gt;
  ...
&lt;/freeStyleBuild&gt;
</pre>

Parsing XML in shell without the proper tools should make anyone a sad panda.
Luckily, Hudson's XML api allows you to give an <a
href="http://www.w3schools.com/XPath/default.asp">XPath</a> query to restrict
the output:

<pre>
# Show me the text contents of the first artifact/relativePath
% GET 'http://build/hudson/job/helloworld/lastSuccessfulBuild/api/xml?xpath=//artifact[1]/relativePath/text()'
deploy/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/helloworld-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
</pre>

That path is relative to the non-api portion, so fetching the RPM becomes:
http://build/hudson/job/helloworld/lastSuccessfulBuild/deploy/rpmbuild/RPMS...

<p>

Fetching the RPM was only the first step of a deployment process I was building
with Hudson. At work, sometimes engineers do deployments. It is not totally
productive to require them to have working knowledge of rpm, yum, <a
href="http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/mrepo/">mrepo</a>, puppet, linux, ssh,
and other tools that may be necessary. I wanted a one-click deployment that
would do all the right things, in the right order, and would save us from
having to poorly maintain a wiki describing the steps required to perform an
on-demand upgrade.

<p>

As shown above with the API, we can fetch the latest packages. Once that
happens, the exact method of deployment is really up to you and what your
infrastructure needs. My version pushed the rpm to my yum master, then
replicated to the per-site mirrors, then ssh'd to each related server, upgraded
the package, and restarted any service required. The benefits of this are
two-fold: we retire a poorly maintained upgrade howto document, and we relieve
some engineers of the burdens of being intimate with the infrastructure, so
they can just worry about writing and testing code.

<p>

One small trick, however. Since Hudson has a 'build now' button, I didn't want
stray clicks or accidents to incur a new deployment. The workaround was to add
<a
href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Parameterized+Build">checkbox</a>
to the build that simply asked for confirmation. Without the checkbox checked,
the build would fail.

<p>

Now armed with an automated, but still human-initiated, deployment process, it
is fairly easy to extend your deployment script to include email notifications,
nagios silences, and other actions that help make your deployment more safe and
reliable.

<p>

While I am not certain that Hudson is the end-game of helping coworkers do deployments to production and staging, I am comfortable with this solution given that it works well, was very easy to implement, and relieves the knoweldge transfer problems mentioned above.

<p>

Even if you don't like Hudson for deployment, it's a great build server.
