<p>
When your environment has grown beyond direct attached storage (internal
drives, or an external drive array) and basic network attached storage (NAS),
the next step is generally to consider implementing a storage area network
(SAN); however, the cost and complexity of existing Fibre Channel and iSCSI SAN
solutions can be daunting. Fortunately, ATA over Ethernet (AoE) can often be
used as a simpler, lower-cost alternative.
</p>

<p>
Before diving into AoE, you should be aware of its limitations.  The major
idiosyncrasy of AoE is that it does not use TCP/IP; therefore, it is not
routable.  Also, compared to iSCSI, it lacks encryption and user-level access
control.  AoE truly shines when you simply need storage over a local network,
and can limited access by control over physical ports on a switch, VLANs, etc.
</p>

<p>
AoE is supported on a wide variety of operating systems, including 
<a href="http://support.coraid.com/support/linux/">Linux</a>,
<a href="http://www.winaoe.org/">Windows</a>,
<a href="http://support.coraid.com/support/freebsd/">FreebSD</a>,
<a href="http://support.coraid.com/support/esx/">VMWare ESX</a>,
<a href="http://support.coraid.com/support/solaris/">Solaris</a>,
<a href="http://www.2degreesfrost.com/index.html">Mac OS X</a>,
and OpenBSD.  Like Fibre Channel, iSCSI, and other storage protocols, the AoE
protocol implements an initiator-target architecture - the initiator sends
commands, and the target receives them.  On Linux, various pieces of software
are used to provide initiator and target functionality.  Four independently
developed AoE targets exist for Linux: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/qaoed/">qaoed</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ggaoed/">ggaoed</a>, <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/kvblade/">kvblade</a>, and <a href="http://aoetools.sourceforge.net/">vblade</a>.
Since vblade is part of <a
  href="http://aoetools.sourceforge.net/">aoetools</a>, it generally seems to
have the most active development community; therefore, we'll use that for our
example setup. Depending on the version of AoE you use, it can be used with
Linux kernels 2.4.x or 2.6.x; however, it is best used with kernel 2.6.14 or higher and newer
  versions of <a href="http://aoetools.sourceforge.net/">aoetools</a>.  
</p>

<p>
For our example configuration, we'll be setting up AoE on Debian Linux (Lenny),
and using <a href="http://sourceware.org/lvm2/">LVM2</a>.  The AoE module
should be included if you're using a standard Debian kernel, but let's check
using:
</p>

<pre>
grep ATA_OVER /boot/config-`uname -r`
</pre>

Which should return:

<pre>
CONFIG_ATA_OVER_ETH=m
</pre>

<p>
That means AoE is supported through a kernel module.  If you aren't already
using AoE, the module is probably not loaded yet.  Let's load it, and add it to
/etc/modules so it is automatically loaded at when the system is started in the
future:
</p>

<pre>
modprobe aoe
echo "aoe" >> /etc/modules
</pre>

On Debian, we'll use apt to install the remaining necessary components:

<pre>
apt-get update
apt-get install lvm2 vblade vblade-persist aoetools
</pre>

<p>
Note that aoetools includes the following tools:

<p>
For our example, we'll use LVM2 and AoE to allocate space and make it available
over the network, using two disks.  For a recent project, I used 13 drives on a
hardware RAID controller and divided them into two RAID6 arrays of 6 (4TB) and
7 (5TB) drives.
</p>

<p>
Assuming the disks are the second and third disks on a Linux system, configure
LVM2 to recognize the physical volumes:
</p>

<pre>
pvcreate /dev/sdb
pvcreate /dev/sdc
</pre>

<p>
Create two LVM2 volume groups on the physical volumes - for our example, let's
call them content and backups:
</p>

<pre>
vgcreate content /dev/sdb
vgcreate backups /dev/sdc
</pre>

<p>
Then create two 1TB LVM2 logical partitions (/dev/content/server1,
/dev/backups/server1):
</p>

<pre>
lvcreate -L 1TB -n server1 content
lvcreate -L 1TB -n server1 backups
</pre>

<p>
Although there are many different types of filesystems available under Linux,
for familiarity and to avoid unnecessary complexity in our example, we'll use
ext3:
</p>

<pre>
mkfs.ext3 /dev/content/server1
mkfs.ext3 /dev/backups/server1
</pre>

<p>
Now that we have our drives configured with LVM2 and formatted with a usable
filesystem, we can setup the AoE target using vblade-persist:
</p>

<pre>
vblade-persist setup 0 1 eth0 /dev/content/server1
vblade-persist setup 0 2 eth0 /dev/backups/server1
vblade-persist start 0 1
vblade-persist start 0 2
</pre>

<p>
To mount our newly created AoE devices on a remote server, run the following on
a second server:
</p>

<pre>
modprobe aoe
apt-get install aoetools
aoe-discover
aoe-stat    # should show the available AoE exports
mkdir /mountpoint
# replace e0.1 with the appropriate device from aoe-stat
mount /dev/etherd/e0.1 /mountpoint 
</pre>

<p>
Your options in the storage are many. This introduction should give you the
necessary tools to decide if AoE is the storage solution that meets your
requirements.
