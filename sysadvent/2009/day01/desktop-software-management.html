Software Installer Management

I find reinstalling Windows laptops and workstations pretty tedious. You need to
reinstall Windows, first, right? Then hope that the network bits are supported
by the base install, and when they aren't, get a thumbdrive and shuttle over the
network drivers, then download the rest of the drivers for any devices you need.
After that you need to go about installing extra software like web browsers,
office tools, printers, etc, and then go about configuring all of that madness.

It makes me tired just thinking about it. The biggest pain point for me is
tracking down all of those installable bits each time I need to do a reinstall.
Some vendors are nice and ship a driver cd. Dell does this, but the interface it
provides is worse than horrible.

Ultimately, this boils down to wanting to avoid the time and effort required to
find the right drivers for the right system. The cost (time, patience) of
finding each driver or support software is relatively fixed, so let's optimize
the process and only perform this "find the right driver" once.

The end result we want is really a local, central, and organized repository of
things we need to install on workstations and laptops. I like subversion for
solving this. You may not want to use subversion, or any revision control at
all, and that's fine - it is just a means to an end of "local, central,
organized repository of software/drivers."

My search path for finding a given piece of laptop software usually starts with
the hardware model, then the thing I need (network driver, or whatever), so it
makes sense to use that order in the subversion layout: Such as
/vendor/model/category - where vendor is the vendor of your laptop or
workstation. This saves you from having to remember that a given laptop has a
broadcom network chip, you just know what laptop you have and that it needs a
network chip.

<dl>
<dt> /Dell/Latitude_E5400/network/... </dt>
<dd> Network drivers for a Dell Latitude E5400 </dd>
<dt> /Dell/Latitude_E5400/audio/... </dt>
<dd> Audio driver for a Dell Latitude E5400 </dd>
</dl>

For cases where you have the same piece of software (such as a wireless driver)
across different models, you can use <a
  href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/ch07s03.html">svn externals</a>,
which let you do symlink-like things in your svn repository. Doing that, you can
have 'network' in the example above be an external reference to another
directory that contains the common driver for that network device, which can
save you some space in your svn repo.

The next step is getting those drivers portable and making them available to
fresh-installs that may not have networking. Doing an svn checkout to a
thumbdrive lets you easily get these drivers to the host that needs them, if
there's no network on that host. Updating your thumbdrive is a simple 'svn up'
(or right-click, update via Tortoise SVN in Windows) and you're done.

You can easly extend this repository to include configs and installer
automation. Further, since we're sorting by vendor and model, you can
extend this idea to include things like switch firmware and other versionable
blobs.

This practice of having a local, central, and organized repository of drivers
and other software packages helps you avoid repeatedly having to search for the
same piece of software multiple times.
