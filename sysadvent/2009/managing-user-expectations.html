<h2>Managing User Expectations</h2>

<i> This article written by <a href="http://www.dixongroup.net/">Jason Dixon</a></i>

<p>Show me a carefree Systems Administrator and I'll show you someone
who doesn't interact with users.  The typical End-User (<em>userus
idiotus</em>) is a lazy creature, disposed towards foolishness and
lacking in common sense.  Although many of us are equipped with the
prescience to avoid them, the Business Office (<em>paycheckus
routineous</em>) demands that we cater to their whims and folly.</p>

<p>While it's fun to be a <a
href="http://bofh.ntk.net/Bastard_Indexes.html">Bastard Operator From
Hell</a>, sometimes we just need to get along with our users.  Managing
those relationships is an important part of daily SA life, one that we
frequently take for granted.  Besides the fact that <em>some</em> of
these folks are decent people, there are usually orthogonal benefits
(money, sanity, free beer) that go along with keeping them happy.  I've
developed a few guiding principles over the years that can help any
bastard get along with his or her users.</p>

<h3>Underpromise, Overdeliver</h3>

<p>First, it's vitally important to set user expectations accordingly.
Anxious users will expect that their problem is the most important thing
on your plate, because it's the obstacle keeping them from getting work
done.  Resetting their expectations allows you to budget plenty of time
to complete the task.  And you'll be seen as the rock star Sys Admin
that delivered the solution early.</p>

<ul style="padding-left: 15px; font-size: 0.8em;">
<li> Kevin: &nbsp; Pam, when will the new copier be ready?</li>
<li>Pam: &nbsp; I'm working on it Kev.</li>
<li>Kevin: &nbsp; You said it would be ready by today. And it is today.</li>
<li>Pam: &nbsp; It'll be ready soon.</li>
<li>Kevin: &nbsp; Soon could mean anything. Soon could be three weeks.</li>
<li>Pam: &nbsp; Is that what soon means to you?</li>
<li>Kevin: &nbsp; Sometimes...</li>
<li>Pam: &nbsp; Then come back soon.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Educate Without Patronizing</h3>

<p>Believe it or not, there are scores of users who like to fix their
own problems.  They simply lack the skills to get it done or to avoid
making it worse.  Many of the common troubleshooting techniques we use
each day can be passed on to others (checking cables, rebooting, minor
software updates) if we take a few minutes to <em>patiently</em> walk
them through it.</p>

<p>Teach, but don't condescend.  Just because you have an aptitude for
computers doesn't make you a genius.  We each have our own areas of
expertise.  Theirs may be kicking you in the nuts.</p>

<h3>Avoid the Trigger-Finger NO</h3>

<p>Years ago, I had a bad habit of immediately saying <em>NO</em> to
strange requests before fully vetting them.  After a few minutes I would
find myself reconsidering the problem, searching for whatever unorthodox
solution presented itself.  While the user was generally happy when
these situations resolved themselves, the experience was probably
confusing at best, and discouraging at worst.  In all likelihood, this
trigger response was a mechanism I'd developed for queuing up unusual
requests.</p>

<p>Just say <em>Maybe</em>.  Your users will appreciate the candor.  It
gives you time to investigate the matter thoroughly (see:
<em>Underpromise, Overdeliver</em>) and instills them with the belief
that you're giving it your best shot.</p></div>
