Sysadmins troubleshoot using mental abstractions. Our knowledge of a system can
never be complete; we are always missing information when troubleshooting.
Abstractions are used to cover gaps in our knowledge, and allow us to fix
problems without knowing all of the details.

<p>

Abstractions are a sysadmins most powerful tool and potentially our biggest
weakness.

<blockquote>
A co-worker (let's call him Ralph) had been troubleshooting a users computer
for two hours when he finally called me. I walked to where Ralph was working,
he looked frustrated and exhausted,

<blockquote>
"I've tried every thing I can think of, but this system will not stay on the
network."

<p>

"Really? What have you tried?", I asked.

<p>

"Updating the drivers, a reboot, re-seating the NIC, loopback tests, I checked the switch config, and I even updated the BIOS."

<p>

"Really?", I questioned.

<p>

"Yeah. No dice."

</blockquote>
 
I took a deep breath, and thought about what he said.

<p>

I turned around and left the room without saying a word.

<p>

I walked down to the communications closet, found the right cable and pulled it
out. I bent the plastic clip back and inserted it back into the switchport with
a satisfying *click*. The link-light went green.

<p>

I walked back into the room, sat down at the computer and executed a few well
practiced keyboard maneuvers (/release and /renew). The network connection was
established.

<p>

The user was very grateful (probably had an ebay auction), I mumbled something
about a switch configuration error and we'd be sure to look into it. After we
left, I told Ralph, what happened.

<p>

"#&%$! How did I miss that?"

<p>

"It's simple. You took something for granted."

We can take abstractions for granted, and forget to see the obvious. When we
abstract the portion of our knowledge that contains the problem, we come to a
point where we cannot troubleshoot even the simplest issue. This can be
embarrassing, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumption_trap">undermine our own confidence in our work</a>.

<p>

This happens to everyone, even senior sysadmins. Tom Limoncelli has an
excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumption_trap">List of Dumb
  Things To Check</a>, that's filled with some simple (and some complex) things
that have caused hours of wasted time for sysadmins.

<p>

All too often when troubleshooting it's easy to think of every possible thing
that could go wrong. We get caught up in our own abstractions and forget about
reality. We must focus on the moment, and deliberately acknowledge where we've
created abstractions.

<p>

This is a deliberate form of thinking, and it takes some practice. In Zen this
is called it # #  (shoshin), the Beginners Mind. Seeing everything fresh, as if
it were the first time you've seen it. Being in the moment. Being deliberate.

<p>

The next time a complex problem occurs, take a minute (take a deep breath), and
deliberately choose your abstractions. If you don't know why you've chosen one
("Is the network cable plugged in?") question it, observe it, and understand
it.

Deliberately choosing your thoughts will not only help you troubleshoot, it
will bring a vitality and freshness to your work. You will see things that you
haven't seen before and understand things few others do. Your work will feel
more like play, and you will enjoy the simple as well as the complex problems.
