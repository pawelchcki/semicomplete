<p>In a previous life, I was the sysadmin at a small non-profit that
helped organize conferences.  We solicited proposals, approved
budgets, and helped the organizers whenever we could.  Since the
organizers were scattered around the country, we used web-based tools
to do all this.  My newly-created position combined that of a
part-time SA and part-time web developer: provide registration and
payment forms, and let organizers keep track of registrations.</p>

<p>There were a number of problems^Wchallenges I faced:</p>

<ul>

<li>The database had evolved over time, and so had the web front end
we used to manage it.  The database schema was completely
undocumented.</li>

<li>Registration forms had been created anew for each conference,
because each conference's requirements were different.</li>

<li>Another person who worked on the database front end didn't believe
in revision control, or testing his changes; it was live data or
nothing, baby!</li>

<li>Everything was written in PHP.  PHP, used in anger, lets you get
away with a *lot* of bad things.</li>

<li>Conference season was coming up -- soon.</li>
</ul>

<p>What to do?</p>

<p>I did the only thing I could do: I made mistakes.  I trampled over
data.  I banged my head against my desk and cursed the day I'd ever
taken this job.  And I learned some things that developers are
<i>taught</i> -- and that we sysadmins are rarely told.</p>

<p>Maybe it's assumed we'll never need to know these things....yet in my
experience, we're often called on to be developers.  Maybe you're at a
small shop like I was, and there simply isn't anyone else to take care
of The Big Important App.  Maybe you're adapting a Free Software
project for inside use.  Or maybe you're finding that the quick hack,
lashed together in desperation and anger, has suddenly become useful
for other people...and now they're coming back with ideas.</p>

<p>Development is more than learning a language.  That part is *easy*,
like learning how to use a hammer, or a drill, or a saw.  But learning
how to build something that doesn't fall apart in the slightest wind
is <i>hard</i>, whether you're doing programming or carpentry.</p>

<p>When that app falls apart -- or better yet, before -- here's what to
do.</p>

<h2>Use revision control</h2>

<p>Use it <i>always</i>; there is simply no excuse not to.  You need it to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Record changes -- not just what, but why</li>

<li>Revert easily to older, working versions when you screw something up</li>

<li>Tell your boss what bugs you've fixed</li>
</ul>

<p>If there's something already in place at work, or that you're
already familiar with, or you're working on a project that has settled
on a particular tool, use it. Otherwise, use <a
href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>; it's simple, it
works, it's available for your OS, and you can always convert later
on.</p>

<p>Learn how to commit and revert changes, then read up on branching,
merging and tagging -- not just how, but why.  Are you going to be
introducing a new feature?  Start a branch, then merge back to the
main line.  Are you going to be making a release?  Start a branch, do
what you need then leave it unchanged.</p>

<p>What if you're the only developer?  Then it's at least fourteen times
more important.  Trust me, you're not going to remember what the
difference was between "foo.php.old-1" and "foo.backup.2" at 4:15 on a
Friday afternoon, let alone at 3am on a Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Read the books that are available for your tool, and the
ones for the tools you passed up.  Not only do
they usually contain good introductions to revision control, but
you'll get an idea of what kind of development style they encourage.
Don't get hung up on that yet; just stick it in the back of your
head.</p>

<h2>Learn how to test</h2>

<p>Here's a good mistake: on one registration form, I forgot to insert
email addresses into the database.  I was unaware of this until the
organizer asked about emailing everyone to notify them of a change in
venue.  I fixed my mistake (confirmation emails CC'd to myself FTW!);
then I started looking for ways to test my code.</p>

<p>There are three kinds of tests you'll hear about:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Unit testing</i> ask "Does this module/function do what I think it
does?"  In my case, I added a unit test that looped over all the
data I *thought* I was inserting into the database and made sure
they were there.</li>

<li><i>Regression testing</i> asks "Have I re-introduced any old bugs in my
latest changes?"  Every time you find a bug, add a test *before* you
start work on a fix.  That test should fail <i>until</i> you commit your
fix; after that, it should continue to pass.  If it doesn't, you've
re-introduced a bug.  (The line between unit testing and regression
testing can be fuzzy; don't worry about that.)</li>

<li><i>Acceptance testing</i> asks "Does the customer like what I've done, and
does it do what they expected?"  Depending on the project, the
customer may be you, your boss, your co-workers or the public.  This
is another way of saying "It's not done 'til they say it's done."</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll hear people talking about test-driven development.  This means
you write a test <i>before</i> you write any code.  By laying out what you
expect in advance, you know exactly when you're done (because the test
passes) and you can refactor (rewrite) a function easily if it becomes
cumbersome.  If you've got the time and you're starting from scratch,
it's an excellent way of doing things.  Otherwise, you may find it
difficult to bolt on afterward.</p>

<p>The way you test your code may depend on what language you're using
and what you're familiar with.  In my case, I used Perl for testing,
even though the code it was testing was PHP.  I was more fluent in
Perl, and there were two excellent modules (<a
href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?WWW::Automate">WWW::Automate</a>
and <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::More">Test::More</a>) that
made it easy to test my forms.  (I'm not familiar with tools for
testing more AJAX-y web apps, but there are lots of <a
href="http://freshmeat.net/search?q=web+browser+testing&submit=Search">open-source
tools</a> that are worth investigating.)</p>

<p>You should be testing your code <i>at least</i> in preparatation for beta
testing; in my case, running the tests took less than a minute, so it
was trivial to run them near-constantly.</p>

<h2>Learn about development, testing and production</h2>

<p>If you're a sysadmin at a larger company, you probably know about
the difference between these environments already...but my background
is different, and this was something I had to learn the hard way.</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Development</i> is exactly what it sounds like: you banging on your
keyboard and writing stuff.</li>

<li><i>Testing</i> is where you put the changes you've made through
all your tests.</li>

<i><i>Production</i> is when your code goes live.</li>
</ul>

<p>Big places will probably have different machines and environments
for each.  (They probably also have golden coffee cup holders for
their sysadmins.)  You may find that the line between these
environments is more fuzzy.  But you should have some kind of sandbox
for your development and/or testing.</p>

<p>When you're testing, think about how you're going to get
convincing/realistic data.  In my case, I was able to take a copy of
the live database and test with that.</p>

<p>At a small shop, you may find it difficult to isolate yourself
completely from your production environment.  In that case, work hard
to make it hard to shoot yourself in the foot.  In my case, I was
paranoid about accidentally connecting to the live database while I
was testing.  To get around that, my copy of the database was renamed
and used completely different credentials...so I *couldn't* connect by
accident.</p>

<p>You should also think about how you're going to move this to
production.  I set up my registration forms to automatically switch to
testing mode if the file path they were in included "sandbox"; they
used those different credentials for connecting to the database,
emails went only to me, and more debugging info was shown.  This made
it easy to make it live: just move the files over.</p>

<p>(An important corrollary of this is: have all your configuration info
in one file; <i>do not</i> have Multiple Sources of Truth(tm).  You will
forget to edit something someday, and you will unwittingly unleash the
Reign of Zuul.)</p>

<h2>Everything should be a Makefile</h2>

<p>The developer who hired me for my first SA job had a valuable piece of
advice: Everything should be a Makefile.  What did he mean by that?
Simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>You should be able to type one line, hit enter, then walk away and
come back to a fully compiled and ready-to-install program.</li>

<li>You should have everything you need to compile/assemble/test your
program.</li>

<li>You should be able to run through all tests with one command.</li>
</ul>

<p>Makefile syntax can be hairy, no question, but it's a good way of
having <i>one</i> command do it all.  If you have to enter another command,
it's not done yet.</p>

<h2>Pick a coding style and stick with it</h2>

<p>Placement of brackets, whitespace and functionNamingStyles are just
like every other religious war: it's not usually worth your time.  The
point is to pick <i>something</i> and move on.  Consistency will help you
-- and your successor -- get familiar with your code again after a
long absence.</p>

<p>If you don't know where to start, have a look at the Linux coding
style document, or at Perl Best Practices by Damien Conway --
whichever is closest to hand right now.  If your language offers a
tool that does automagic formatting (like Perltidy or phptidy), use
it.  Otherwise, here are some things that work for me, cherry-picked
from both of those books:

<ul>
<li>Stick to 80 columns, and remember that a function more than 3
screens long should probably be split up.  (Why?  Because screen
space is equivalent to brain space, and you don't have that much.)</li>

<li>Don't use global variables.  (Why?  Because you'll change it
somewhere else and <i>think</i> you'll keep track of it...but you
won't.  Or you'll have to scroll through fourteen different functions
to find where it changed; see above re: screen space.)</li>

<li>If a function has more than two arguments and your language
supports it, name them.  IOW, do:</i>

<code>
foo(foo="1", bar="2", baz="aardvark", bling="emacs")
</code>

<p>rather than</p>

<code>
foo(1, 2, "aardvark", "emacs")
</code>

<p>(Why?  Because you'll forget the right order.)</p>

<p>Are you detecting a pattern here?  Good, because that brings me to
the final point.</p>

<h2>Remember, you're not going to remember</h2>

<p>Documentation, comments, consistent coding style, shooting global
variables on sight -- these are all synonyms for "I need to write this
down."  Just like you document your network, or your web server
config, or your vendor support, you need to write down what you've
done, you need to make it understandable, and you need to make it
simple.</p>

<p>And keep in mind what <a
href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan">Brian Kernighan
said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a
program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be
when you write it, how will you ever debug it?
</blockquote>

<p>Words worth remembering.</p>
