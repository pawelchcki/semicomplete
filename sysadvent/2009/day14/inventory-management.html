<p>If you work in smaller environments, like I do, the need for inventory
software can seem...well, distant.  Maybe you can keep track of
everything already, or maybe that spreadsheet or wiki page is just
fine.</p>

<p>But what happens when you upgrade it?  What about when you want to get
more information, like service tags or the number of DIMM slots in
use?  What about keeping a history of each machine, so you can see
what problems you've had with it before?  Or what about simply
hitting the jackpot and getting ten or twenty or fifty machines in a
week?</p>

<p>Relax.  OCS Inventory NG and GLPI are here to help.</p>

<h4>OCS Inventory NG</h4>

<p>OCS Inventory NG is a French project released under the GPL. It
helps you:</p>

<ul>
<li>keep track of your systems, including a full inventory of software
and hardware</li>
<li>manage the inventory using a web interface</li>
<li>deploy packages to your systems as needed</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, I'll be honest: I don't use the package management part of
OCSNG.  (I use cfengine for that.) Instead, I use the agent software
to get machines to inventory themselves.</p>

<p>The OCSNG agent a clever tool that runs well on both Unix (I've tested it
on OpenBSD, CentOS and Ubuntu Linux, and Solaris) and Windows (I've
only tried it on Windows XP so far).  It takes an inventory of the
hardware (including things like Dell service tags), number and type of
hard drives, and MAC addresses, and reports it via the web
interface.</p>

<p>(One gotcha:  I tried for a while to get the web interface to work
behind Apache's mod_reverse_proxy, but this failed.  In the end I gave
up and put the website on a server available directly from my
networks.)</p>

<p>Because the agent is meant to be self-sufficient, it will
automagically install the various Perl modules it needs if it can't
find them and put them under its installation directory (/opt/OCSNG by
default).  I'd rather grab those modules using the distro's package
management tool, so I wish there was a way to turn that behaviour off.
However, that's a minor nit.</p>

<p>You'll notice that the management website is kind of spare.  This
is where GLPI shines.</p>

<h4>GLPI</h4>

<p>GLPI is <i>another</i> French, GPL'd tool, and it complements OCS
Inventory quite well.  It has a much broader aim: rather than simply
keeping track of your machines, it allows you to keep a whole swath of
information abou them.  Problems and their resolution, support
contracts, contact people, random notes -- GLPI wil track it all.</p>

<p>Again, though, I already have tools for much of this (Request
Tracker for tickets, FosWiki for documentation).  What I really like
about GLPI are the inventory tools.</p>

<p>GLPI will certainly let you add new machines manually to its
inventory. There is a plugin for GLPI called OCS Import that will
let you suck data in from your OCSNG installation, and that's what
I've done.</p>

<p>Installing the plugin is simple; adding new machines takes a bit
more work.  Rather than automagically grabbing info from OCSNG
whenever it shows up, the plugin allows you to specify machines to
insert into GLPI, or to update afterward.</p>

<p>(Originally, I was going to write that it was a shame that you had
to do this by hand; not just the first time, but every time the
information in OCSNG got updated.  However, it turns out there
<i>is</i> a script in the plugin to do a mass synchronization of
GLPI with OCSNG and is suitable for running from cron.  Memo to
myself:  RTFM.)</p>

<p>GLPI's interface is easy to use.  You can update location
information, add PDFs of support contracts, or change the responsible
person.  You can export inventory lists to PDF. Additionally, you can
extend its functionality with a multitude of plugins, covering
everything from order management to exporting notes to Outlook to
showing Snort alerts.</p>

<p>You've tried chocolate and peanut butter; now try OCS Inventory NG
and GLPI.  You'll like it.</p>
