This post was inspired by my brother-in-law asking me what seemed like a
simple question: "how do I become a sysadmin."  It turns out the answer is not
so easy.
</p>

<p>
The title, "systems administrator," is sufficiently vague so as to be
completely useless as a description of one's job duties.  I've <a
href="http://blog.funnelfiasco.com/?p=133">written in the past</a> about
the variety of tasks a sysadmin might encounter in a given day.  With such a
range of duties, it should come as no surprise that there's more than one path
to becoming a sysadmin.  Knowing a wider sample would better capture all the
possibilities, I posed a simple question to respected colleagues and to the
community at ServerFault: how did you become a sysadmin?
</p>

<p>
It turns out that very few people dream of becoming a sysadmin as a child.
Most sysadmins got their start by combining an interest in computers with
another interest or skill.  The combination isn't always intentional.  Some
people just happened to fix the right person's computer one day, or got saddled
with systems administration on top of their regular job duties.  For others, it
is the natural next step.  An experienced developer who no longer feels like
developing is often a great candidate to maintain the systems that the
developers use.  Many others move up through the ranks, starting out at the
help desk and gradually gaining knowledge and responsibility.  One person's
career path even made a brief stop as a strip club bouncer.

<p>
For many people, myself included, there was little formal training in
computers.  My degree is in meteorology, and I know of several people who got
started in the sciences or engineering.  The reason for their success is
two-fold.  In academic environments, it helps to understand the science behind
the work the users are doing. The other reason is that scientists and engineers
are trained to think a certain way - to approach and solve problems in a
logical and systematic manner.  The fundamental job of a system administrator
is to solve problems or anticipate future problems, so having a scientific
mindset is a strong asset.
</p>

<p>
So if formal training in computers isn't necessary to become a sysadmin, what
is? 
</p>

<p>
The willingness to learn is key.  A successful sysadmin spends a lot of time
learning, whether it is about new software, new hardware, new processes, or USB
missile launchers.  If you want to become a sysadmin, the first thing you need
to do is to start learning.   The learning can be accomplished in many ways.
Formal education, in the form of classes or vendor-provided training, can be
very valuable.  Learning at the shoulder of someone more experienced provides
some gaps, but gives you knowledge that can only come from experience.  And of
course, there's self-education.  The bulk of my early learning came from
tinkering with (and breaking) my own computers, and by reading "___ For
Dummies" books.  It's amazing what you learn when you have to fix your
mistakes.
</p>

<p>
So what do you need to learn?  Everything.  I won't get into the technical
skills, because those will vary from position to position. I mean, you might
need to know how to set up an Exchange server, or how to tune NFS performance,
or how to manage a print server, or...well, you get the idea.  To really be a
successful sysadmin, you need to learn some indispensable, if tangential,
skills.  Technical documentation may be the most important skill for sysadmins,
because you will at some point forget every important piece of information that
you need to know.  Writing documentation for users is also invaluable,
especially if you want to spend less time answering questions.  Project
management, personnel management, and budgeting skills also come in handy.
</p>

<p>
Armed with all of this knowledge, you're ready to become a sysadmin and find
out how much you don't know (hint: no matter how much you know, there's always
more that you don't).  Getting the first job is the hardest, and you might need
to start out doing non-sysadmin work.  Help desk support, programming, or
anything else that gets you in the door gives you the opportunity to start
learning new skills and taking on responsibilities.  The only common theme
among the answers I received is that there's no common education, minimum
skills requirement, or career path.  Each sysadmin is unique.  I'll leave you
with a few of the most amusing quotes:
</p>

<blockquote>
"I think I did something horrible to someone in a previous life and this was my
punishment. Anyone else feel like that?"
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Enlisted in the Army for a completely unrelated job. Made the mistake of
fixing the commander's email. Voila! I became a sysad."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"I am a sysadmin because one beautiful summer day, I found a computer laying in
a field."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Why would someone want to get into this job?  I strongly suggest he get into
driving heavy machinery.  That's what I'm gonna do when I grow up."
</blockquote>
