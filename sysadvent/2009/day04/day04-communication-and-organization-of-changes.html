Communication and Organization of Changes

<p>
<a

happens. Maintenance, (planned or unplanned) outages, upgrades, etc. A change
can be something small, such as tweaking a configuration value, or they can be
large, such as replacing power units on hundreds racks across multiple
datacenters. Changes come in all shapes, sizes, scopes, and risks, and require
varying degrees of planning, scheduling, and cooperation.

<p>
Communication is an important piece of the change process, and good
communication allows you to inform users and groups about pending changes and
change impact. Good communication requires using the right tools, so it's worth
reviewing the tools that are available to you:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Email. Email is easy to send, and maintaining mailing lists for users of
  any given component is pretty easy. However, like wikis, nobody reads email.
  I'll cover how to work around this shortly. </li>
  <li> Calendar. Everyone understands calendars. They grew up living with them,
  the presentation is familiar, and it is based on a concept everyone
  understands: time. </li>
  <li> Bug/Issue/Ticket systems. These systems are good for tracking work
  units, such as changes. They tend to have status-setting features including
  words like "need feedback," "in progress," and "resolved." Seems like a good
  fit for tracking the progress of a change.</li>
  <li> Phones. Phones are good when you need synchronous communication, such as
  when coordinating a change across geographics, or calling customers to get
  acknowledgement of a proposed change.</li>
  <li> Meetings. Meetings are good places to announce changes, scheduling, and
  impact. Attendees can nod quietly or object to the change or scheduling. This
  helps you review a change and fit its schedule to minimize risk and impact.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Every change will not need to involve every tool listed above. Further, the
tools you use to communicate, plan, and log changes will depend greatly on the
culture and size of your company and on the impact and risks of each change.
Use the tools that fit best.
</p>

<p>
For email, have an 'it-changes' or 'ops-changes' or 'yourteamname-changes'
mailing list that has your team (which can just be you) and anyone else who is
interested in the changes you are making. Additionally, create a mailing list
for any component that might need maintenance, such as a datacenter location, a
service like Active Directory, or the network filer; document these
and encourag people needing a particular component subscribe to those mailing
lists. Use your judgement here. If your company is small, you can probably
create fewer mailing lists.
</p>

<p>
Like engineers who need to consider unreliable networks in their design, you
must consider unreliable readers in your change announcements. Folks don't read
email; they skim and read things they think are important, which means they may
skip your change announcement. Further, there is often no feedback from email -
you won't get any acknowledgement of who has read an announcement, or more
importantly, that they have understood it. The best way to ensure your
announcements are read are by targeting only the people who need the
information and by repeating your message. Depending on the size and impact of
the change, you may need to send your change announcement up to three times.
First, to announce the scheduled change. Second, a day (or hour) before the
change starts. Third, when the change starts. A final, "all clear," message
should be sent when the maintennace is complete. 
</p>

<p>
Email has some failings, like no acknowledgements. Calendars can do this, and
more. Calendars are great visual tools for communicating schedules.  Online
calendars (in Exchange, Google Calendar, whatever) are great for several
reasons. First, you can invite people to the event, which gives them a visual
reminder in their calendar.  Further, you get reminders for free: Just before
the event starts, your invitees will likely get a popup reminding them of an
change. Additionally, Calendars are shareable and publishable.  Calendar data
exchange is pretty standardized - iCalendar format sends well over email.
Invitees can acknowledge receipt, helping you figure out who hasn't
acknowledged and might need a phone call. Finally, calendars can often be
downloaded to smartphones and other devices. All of these are excellent
features of modern online calendars which will help you communicate changes
more effectively.

</p>

<p>
You should schedule maintenance and outages in a calendar.  Create a calendar
(or multiple, using the same principles from the mailing list creation above)
to track these events. Invite people and groups who need to know about the
event. The data in each event should include two things: a short description
(think email subject) and a link to wherever the detailed plan/discussion for
the change lives, which is likely an issue/bug system. For an unplanned outage,
create an event that represents the actual time and duration of the outage.
</p>

<p>
Ticket (aka bug or issue) systems should be used to track individual changes.
As mentioned above, you get the state-tracking benefits (open, pending,
in-progress, fixed, etc) and a reasonable place to record planning notes and
actions taken during a change. Your emails and calendar entries should include
links to the change ticket if it is relevant. The ticket should also, if
possible, include a link to the calendar event for easy import into other
calendars.
</p>

<p>
Phones and meetings are of similar use as they both grant you synchronous
communication. Phones and in-person meetings are good for the planning stage.
They are also both good for reviewing pending changes or for confirming that
all involved acknowledge the change. Your use depends on your needs. For
example, a previous job had weekly meetings to discuss impact and scheduling of
planned changes. Phone is also a useful tool for calling in more experienced
teammates when there's a problem with a change.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, you are a customer, too. Others will make changes that affect you.
Datacenter facilities, ISPs, and other service providers make changes just like
you do. I would love if my service providers sent me change notifications with
calendar invites, but nobody does. Do your vendors send you change
notifications? Do they include calendar data you can import into your own
calendars? Do they follow the advice above?  If you said no to any of these,
it's worth having a chat with your vendors and providers to help work towards
this.
</p>

<p>
Remember, we are often guilty of undercommunicating and even communicating
poorly. Focusing on effective communication of changes will help ensure your
customers (coworkers, users, clients, etc) are well-informed of the changes
that affect them. Informed customers are happy customers. As mentioned in the
previous paragraph, as a customer, making you a happy may require you working
with your service providers to sell them on the advice here.
