Cfengine3 marks the third major version of the original configuration
management started 16 years ago. Like Puppet, Chef, Bcfg2, and others, Cfengine
helps you automate the configuration and maintenance of your systems.

<p>

I chose cfengine because of it's long track record, large user base, academic origins, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_configuration_management_software#Platform_support">wide platform support</a>, and <a href="https://cfengine.org/mailman/listinfo/help-cfengine">supportive community</a>.

<p>

For the uninitiated, configuration management tools help you maintain a desired
configuration state. If the system is not in the correct state, the config
management tool will perform actions to move into the correct state. For
example, if your state includes a cron job, and one of the systems doesn't have
that cron job, the config management tool will install it. No action would be
taken if the cron job already existed correctly.

<p>

Cfengine has its own mostly declarative language. This language describes how
things should be; with a little bit of imperative to  describe how to do it or
what to do. Using this langauge you create configuration "policy rules" or "promises" of how the system should be configured. Cfengine manages how to get to the promised state.

<p>

In this way, Cfengine becomes your automated systems administrator, a kind of
robot that maintains your system by your definitions. As exampled above: if a
cron job is missing, and you said you wanted it, Cfengine will add it.

<p>

Your job then is promoted to one of configuring this automated system and to
monitor its function. You can configure it to add cron jobs, upgrade software
packages, or remove users, on thousands of hosts as easily as on one host. Use
this tool with care ;)

<p>

Cfengine can be used standalone or in a client-server model. In the latter, if
the server is unreachable, the client is smart and uses the last-seen cached
set of policies and uses those until it can reach the server again. In either
model, the client-side performs the checks and maintenance actions, so this
should scale to thousands of hosts.

<p>

Speaking of using Cfengine, the language syntax in the latest version (3) has
been cleaned up from the previous version, which was varied and inconsistent.

<p>

When using Cfengine, it's important to know some terms:
<dl>
  <dt> Promise </dt>
  <dd> A promise is a Cfengine policy statement - for example, that /etc/shadow
    is only readable by root - and it implies Cfengine will endeavor to keep
    that promise.
  </dd>
  <dt> Pattern </dt>
  <dd> I asked Mark to clarify for us what he means by "patterns" in Cfengine
    3. Here is his answer:

    <blockquote>
    A "configuration" is a design arrangement or a pattern you make with system
    resources. The cfengine language makes it easy to describe and implement
    patterns using tools like lists, bundles and regular expressions. While
    promises are things that are kept, the efficiencies of configuration come
    from how the promises form simple re-usable patterns.
    </blockquote>
  </dd>
  <dt> Class </dt>
  <dd> For you programmers, this has nothing to do with the Object-Oriented
  term. Classes are "if/then" tests but the test itself is hidden "under the
  hood" of Cfengine. There is no way to say "if/then" in Cfengine except with
  classes.

  Example - this shell script will only be executed on Linux systems:

  <pre>shellcommands:
    linux:: "/var/cfengine/inputs/sh/my_script.sh"</pre>

  There are a number of built-in classes, like the <code>linux</code> class
  above; they can also be explicitly defined.
  </dd>

  <dt> Bundle </dt>
  <dd> A bundle is a collection of promises </dd>

  <dt> Body </dt>
  <dd> The body of a promise explains what it is about. Think of the body of a
  contract, or the body of a document. Cfengine "body" declarations divide up
  these details into standardized, paramaterizable, library units. Like
  functions in programming, promise bodies are reusable and parameterized.

  <pre>
  <i>cfengine-word</i> =&gt; <i>user-data-pattern</i>

  body <i>cfengine-word</i> <i>user-data-pattern</i>
  {
      details
  }
</dl>

The basic grammar of Cfengine 3 looks like this:
<pre>
  promisetype:
      classes::
          "promiser" -&gt; { "promisee1", "promisee2", ... }
              attribute_1 =&gt; value_1,
              attribute_2 =&gt; value_2,
              ...
              attribute_n =&gt; value_n;
</pre>

Classes are optional.

Here is the list of promise types:
<ul>
  <li> commands - Run external commands </li>
  <li> files - Handle files (permissions, copying, etc.) </li>
  <li> edit_line - Handle files (content) </li>
  <li> interfaces - Network configuration </li>
  <li> methods - Methods are compound promises that refer to whole bundles of promises. </li>
  <li> packages - Package management </li>
  <li> processes - Process management </li>
  <li> storage - Disk and filesystem management </li>
</ul>

Here's another example:

<pre>
    files:
       "/tmp/test_plain" -&gt; "John Smith",
            comment =&gt; "Make sure John's /tmp/test_plain exists",
            create  =&gt; "true";
</pre>

Above, we have the <i>promisee</i> on the right side of the arrow. The promisee
is "the abstract object to whom the promise is made". This is for documenation.
The commercial version of cfengine uses promisees to generate automated
knowledge maps. The object can be the handle of another promise, recognizing an
interest in the outcome, or an affected person who you might want to contact in
case of emergency.

<p>

How about a more complete and practical example? Lets ensure some ntp and portmap services are running:

<pre>
body common control
{
  # We can give this a version
  version =&gt; "1.0";
  # specify what bundles to apply
  bundlesequence  =&gt; { "check_service_running"  };
}

bundle agent check_service_running
{
    vars:
        # name    type  =>    value
        "service" slist =&gt; {"ntp", "portmap"};
        "daemon_path" string =&gt; "/etc/init.d";

    processes:
        "$(service)"
            comment =&gt; "Check processes running for '$(service)'",
            restart_class =&gt; "restart_$(service)";

    commands:
        "${daemon_path}/${service} start"
            comment =&gt; "Execute the start command for the service",
            ifvarclass =&gt; "restart_${service}";
}
</pre>

Saving this as 'servicecheck.cf' we can test it in standalone mode with cf-agent:

<pre>
% sudo /etc/init.d/portmap status
 * portmap is not running
% sudo /etc/init.d/ntp status    
 * NTP server is not running.

% sudo cf-agent -f ./servicecheck.cf
Q: "...init.d/ntp star":  * Starting NTP server ntpd
Q: "...init.d/ntp star":    ...done.
I: Last 2 QUOTEed lines were generated by promiser "/etc/init.d/ntp start"
I: Made in version '1.0' of './servicetest.cf' near line 20
I: Comment: Execute the start command for the service

Q: "....d/portmap star":  * Starting portmap daemon...
Q: "....d/portmap star":    ...done.
I: Last 2 QUOTEed lines were generated by promiser "/etc/init.d/portmap start"
I: Made in version '1.0' of './servicetest.cf' near line 20
I: Comment: Execute the start command for the service

# Now check to make sure cfengine started our services:
% sudo /etc/init.d/portmap status
 * portmap is running
% sudo /etc/init.d/ntp status    
 * NTP server is running.
</pre>

Configuration management is an essential tool for sane and happy sysadmins.
They help you ensure your systems are correctly configured without repeatedly
consuming your time fighting to maintain the status quo.
