<p>I've been through two big moves in my career.  The first was about
four years ago when the company I was working for moved offices.  It
was only across the street, but it meant shifting the whole company
over.  We had about forty employees at the time, and maybe a hundred
workstations, test servers, and production servers.</p>

<p>The second move was when, earlier this year at my current job, we
finally got to move into our new server room.  This time the scope of
the move was smaller (no workstations, and about twenty servers), but
the new digs were nicer. :-)</p>

<p>I learned a lot from these two moves.  I want to pass those lessons
on to you.</p>

<h2>Have a second set of skilled hands around</h2>

<p>At both places, I was the only sysadmin on staff.  For the first
move, my company hired a consultant for a few days to help me out with
the move and its aftershocks.  It was great to have someone else
around that could help diagnose email problems, run traceroute and
generally run interference while I swore at the servers.</p>

<p>The second time, I thought that four volunteers, plus me, would be
enough... it was only twenty servers, after all.  Mainly, it would be a
question of cabling, then things would just fall into place after
that... right?<p>

<p>Well, the volunteers were excellent -- I can't say enough about
them, but a second set of skilled hands would have simplified things
a <i>lot</i>.  I found myself often switching between them as
questions came up: How do these rack rails work?  Which interface is
eth0?  Did you really mean to put 8U of servers into 4U of space?</p>

<p>Obviously, someone familiar with your network, OS/distro and
thought patterns can help you with network testing, re-jigging Apache
proxy directives, and finding your pizza coupons.  Even something
as simple as being familiar with rack rails helps a lot.</p>

<p>And if you're moving offices, <i>don't</i> do this without the
support of your company.  For the first move there were three of us --
including the CEO -- and I wouldn't want to do it with less bodies or
less influence.</p>

<h2>Don't underestimate how tired you'll be</h2>

<p>In some ways, the first move was easier despite it being much more
involved.  We moved on a Saturday, I got machines up and running on
Sunday, and on Monday, things were mostly working again.  Knowing that
I had the time meant that I could go home with a clear conscience.</p>

<p>The second move, though, was meant to be done in one day.  It was
gonna be simple: I had a checklist for services and boot order, the
network settings were ready to go, and the new server room was quite
close our old server room.  How long could it take to move stuff two
blocks?</p>

<p>Well, the <i>moving</i> took the morning.  De-racking machines,
getting stuff on the elevator and to the truck (thank goodness for
strong movers), then dropping stuff off in the server room left us in
a good position for lunch.</p>

<p>But after lunch, little things cropped up: I'd borked some netmask
settings on a couple key servers.  The rack I'd planned to put the
firewall in was too shallow to accept it.  My placement of the in-rack
switches blocked some PDU outlets.  Some of the rack rails were
fragile, stupidly constructed, and difficult to figure out.</p>

<p>Each of these things were overcome, but it took time.  Before I
knew it, it was 7:15pm, I'd been at it for 11 hours and I was
exhausted.  I had to head home and finish it the next day.
Fortunately, I had the support of my boss in this.</p>

<h2>Don't make the day any worse than it has to be</h2>

<p>At the first move, I'd decided it would be a good idea to switch to
a new phone vendor as we moved into the new building.</p>

<p>I avoided firing by, I later calculated, the skin of my teeth.</p>

<p>Your move will be long.  It will be stressful.  You will trip over
things you didn't plan for, thought you'd planned for, and were sure
someone else was planning for.  Don't add to the misery by making
<i>another</i> big change at the same time.  This goes double for
anything involving a complicated technology with multiple vendors
(including a local monopoly that Does Not Like competition) that will
leave everyone <i>very upset</i> if it fails to work right when they
come in.</p>

<p>Instead, mark it carefully on your calendar for five years in the
future.</p>

<h2>Set up monitoring early</h2>

<p>For the second move, my Nagios box was second on my list of
machines to boot up.  I'd set it up with new addresses ahead of time,
and made sure when it did start that alerts were turned off.</p>

<p>As machines came up, I watched the host and service checks turn
green.  It was a good way to ensure that I hadn't forgotten
anything...if it failed, I'd either forgotten to update the address or
I had a genuine problem.  Either way, I knew about it quickly, and
could decide whether to tackle it right away or leave it for later.</p>

<h2>Don't forget about cabling</h2>

<p>I planned out a lot of things for my second move, and it served me
well.  Service checklists, boot sequences...it had taken a long time,
but it was worth it.  I even had a colour-coded spreadsheet showing
how many rack units, watts and network cables I'd need for each
server.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, what I missed was thinking about the cabling itself.
I'd picked out where the switch in each rack would go, I'd made sure I
had lots of cables of varying lengths around, and so on.  But there
were some things I'd missed that experience -- or a dry run -- would
have caught:</p>

<ul>

<li>Horizontal cable management bars blocked a couple of PDU outlets
each; this was mostly, but not entirely, unavoidable.</li>

<li>PDU outlets were on the wrong side for most -- but not all --
servers, which put power cables right next to network cables.</li>

<li>The switches were right next to some PDU outlets -- and since the
switch outlets went all the way to the side, that meant some network
cables were right next to power cables.</li>

</ul>

<p>A dry run of the cabling would not have been easy. I didn't have a
spare server to rack and check for problems, and some of these things
only emerged when you had a full rack.  But it would have been a lot
<i>less</i> work than doing it all on the day of the move (let alone
swearing at it and leaving it for Christmas maintenance).</p>

<h2>Getting new equipment?  Make sure it works</h2>

<p>As part of the new server room, we got a few bells and whistles.
Among them were a humidifier (necessary since we didn't have a vapour
barrier) and leak detectors that sat on the floor, waiting to yell at
me about floods.  "Woohoo!" I thought.  "We're movin' on up!"</p>

<p>What I <i>didn't</i> think about was how these things worked...or
rather, how I could <i>tell</i> that they worked.  We moved in during
summer, so the humidifier wasn't really necessary.  But when winter
came around and the humidity dropped to 15%, I realized that I had no
idea how to tell if the thing was working.  And when I dug up the
manual, I had no idea what it was talking about.</p>

<p>Same with the leak detection.  I knew it was there, since the
sub-contractor had pointed it out.  I had assumed it was managed by
the monitoring box that had been installed along with it...and since
I was busy right then moving in boxes and getting NFS working, I put
it on the list of stuff to do later.</p>

<p>When I finally did tackle it later, it turned out I was wrong:  it
wasn't part of the other monitoring box.  The box I needed to query
didn't show anything about a leak detector.  And I had no idea how to
test the leak detection once I did figure it out.</p>

<p>In both cases, I erred by assuming that I could figure things out
later.  Most of the time, I can -- and being handy at figuring things
out goes with the job.  But there are limits to our expertise, our
area of familiarity, and our ability to learn whole technologies at
one sitting.  One of the hardest things I've had to realize is
that, while I like to think I'm <i>capable</i> of learning just about
anything I'm likely to try my hand at, it's not <i>practical</i> --
that there are times when you have to give up and say, "That's just
something I'll have to learn in my next life."</p>

<p>I also erred by not asking the installer to walk me through things.
I should have asked for simple steps to test whether they were
working, how to check for problems, and how to reset them.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Moving tests things and people. You (re-)learn what you forgot
about; you find out how to do without missing parts; you come to terms
with the limits of being human.  It's no less true for being
melodramatic, but a few tricks, some obsessive planning, foolhardy
volunteers, and hard work will give you the best war story of all: a
boring one, where everything worked out just fine in the end.</p>
