I find it kind of tragic that System V (SysV) init (/etc/init.d, etc) has
survived as long as it has. Looking at its features, it's a pretty plain
system, so why is it still here? Because it does enough, or has, historically.
However, in the places it lacks, folks make workarounds, extensions, and even
<a
  href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/launchd.html">try</a> to <a
  href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/">vanquish</a> it <a
  href="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/content/selfheal/smf-quickstart.jsp">entirely</a>.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes these workarounds and extensions are done improperly. SysV init often
forces upon programs common tasks such as pid file management, daemonizing
(backgrounding), log management, etc. Most things don't use pid files
correctly, many startup scripts lack a functioning 'status' check, and everyone
reimplements the act of daemonizing (backgrounding) differently. Yuck, I want
less of that.

<p>
Sometimes you also need more. What was <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=parachute+pants">cool in 1980</a> may not be cool today. Providing you more is a project called <a href="http://supervisord.org/"><code>supervisord</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
We need less poorly reimplemented functionality and more modern features.
</p>

<p>
What more is needed? Tools like <a
  href="http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2008/12/day-3-babysitting.html">daemontools</a>,
give you automatic restarts and a single point for controlling
services. 
</p>

<p>
What if you need more? That's where <a
  href="http://supervisord.org/">supervisord</a> comes in. Supervisord gets you
a few more goodies you may find useful, including a management web interface,
an API, including process startup backoff..
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://supervisord.org/install/">Installation</a> is pretty simple and
comes with a <a
  href="http://supervisord.org/manual/current/installing.html#creating_a_configuration_file">sample
  config</a> generator for helping decrease the learning curve. Further, the <a
  href="http://supervisord.org/manual/current/configuration.html">config format</a>
looks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI
  format</a>, so the learning curve there should also be pretty short.
</p>

<p>
I decided to try putting mysql into supervisord for testing, so after creating the default config file:

<pre>
# echo_supervisord_conf > /etc/supervisord.conf
</pre>

I checked ps(1) for how I was running mysql, and put that invocation in <code>supervisord.conf</code>:

<pre>
[program:mysqld]
command=/usr/sbin/mysqld --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql --user=mysql --pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid --skip-external-locking --port=3306 --socket=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
</pre>

Then I ran supervisord (you probably want supervisord to to have an init
script, so it launches on boot, etc)

<pre>
% sudo supervisord

# it's running, so let's check on our mysql server:
% sudo supervisorctl help

default commands (type help <topic>):
=====================================
add    clear  fg        open  quit    remove  restart   start   stop  update 
avail  exit   maintail  pid   reload  reread  shutdown  status  tail  version

snack(~) % sudo supervisorctl status       
mysqld                           RUNNING    pid 26028, uptime 0:00:28
</pre>

Hurray! Supervisord even tries understanding what exit statuses mean. If I send
SIGTERM to mysqld, then mysqld will shutdown gracefully and exit with status 0.
By default, supervisord is configured that an exitcode of 0 is "expected" and
thus it won't restart the process. You can change this by setting the
'autorestart' option to 'true' or by changing which exit codes supervisord
understands as expected with the 'exitcodes' option:

<pre>
[program:mysqld]
command=/usr/sbin/mysqld ...
autorestart=true
</pre>

Supervisord can be told to reload (restarts itself) or to reread the config file. In this case, we can just tell it to reread the config file:

<pre>
snack(~) % sudo supervisorctl reread 
mysqld: changed
</pre>

Now any mysqld exit will be restarted automatically.

<p>

Additional features include the management web interface, which can be enabled
in the config file with the <a
  href="http://supervisord.org/manual/current/configuration.html#inet_http_server"><code>[inet_http_server]</code></a>
configuration and also with the <a
  href="http://supervisord.org/manual/current/configuration.html#unix_http_server"><code>[unix_http_server]</code></a>
  configuration for local-only management. The supervisorctl tool can talk to
  remote servers, so the http server portion isn't just for people.
</p>

<p>
Supervisord also seems easy to extend and supports <a href="http://supervisord.org/manual/current/configuration.html#eventlistener">event notifications</a> if you need it. Supervisord also handles logging of stdout and stderr for you in a reasonably configurable way.

<p>
At time of writing, there are a few shortfalls.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> No HTTPS support on the management interface </li>
  <li> No decent per-program access control </li>
  <li> No 'retry forever' option. <code>startretries</code> defaults to 3 and
  has no value for infinity. Perhaps setting a really huge value for
  startretries is a reasonable workaround, though I tried
  <code>startretries=100000000</code> which seems to work,
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Supervisord may not replace all of your startup scripts, but I highly recommend
it, or something like it, for your important services.
