Most people are not lucky enough to deal with only private networks.
Information needs to be accessible to a wide range of consumers. Weather its
working from home, or accessing a website how do you minimize exposure?
</p>

<p>
Most websites these days are backed by databases. Websites of any significant
size typically have the database on a different host. Most commonly, the
Application Server and Database Servers are in the same data-center (Note: I am
ignoring geo-redundant scale here). How often do remote applications access a
database directly? How often is remote shell access needed for management of a
server? Now, how often are nefarious parties trying to shell into a publicly
available servers? How can you minimize public exposure to services that do not
need to be public facing but need to be accessible remotely?
</p>

<p>
A common solution is the notion of a Management Network and or Application
Network. For our purposes we will combine the Management Network and
Application Network into one Private Network. For this illustration we will
assume a single public facing web server serving omg-estore.com, that
interfaces with two databases.
</p>

<p>
I've run into (and even setup in my earlier days ... shhh don't tell anyone)
topologies that look like this.

<p>
<code>www1</code> is the host that serves omg-estore.com, and <code>db1</code>
and <code>db2</code> are master and slave databases. (Yes, I have ignored
redundant application servers here; stop being so picky). All three machines
are directly on the public network and talk to each other over the public
network. 
</p>

<p>
For security reasons, you probably don't want your databases accessible to the
world, so how do we fix that? We can enable firewall policies: restrict remote
shell access to specific ips and only allow database connections from
<code>www1</code>. This isn't the best solution, though, as your servers are
still on the public network. A firewall misconfiguration can expose your
databases, so you should make security choices that are hard to accidentally
break in a way that exposes you.
</p>

<p>
The first thing you should do is push the databases to a private network. This
can be done with the simple addition of a dedicated nic or just bringing up a
virtual interface (eth0:1) with the private subnet information. I prefer to use
a dedicated nic as they can then connect to a fully private switch, and have
access to a nics worth of bandwidth for database communications.
</p>

The first step:

\                                           /
 -------------------------------------------
                               ,__,    /      
                           ____(oo)  /        
                         /(    (..)           
                        * ||--||              
</pre>

<p>
This is much better: the database servers are no longer directly
accessible on the internet. This change has decreased our exposed surface area
by 2/3. Of course, to manage the db servers or the application server you will
have to log in through the public facing application server. This makes the
application server the a risk. To decrease exposure further, remote access to
the public interface can be disabled.
</p>

<p>
Before disabling public remote shell access, you'll need to create a new access method. Enter the VPN. If it's not obvious at this point, your database
servers should no longer have a public interface. If they do they should be
configured to only listen on the private network, or you should drop all
connections on the left over public interface.  The goal here is to
only expose the services that need to serve public traffic.
</p>

The second step:
<pre>

| -----------            (private net)      |
|           |----(www1)-----|               |
|           |               |---------(db1) |
|           |               |---------(db2) |
|           |----(vpn1)-----|               |
\                                           /
 -------------------------------------------
  \
   \
       __     
      UooU\.'@@@@@@`.
      \__/(@@@@@@@@@@)
           (@@@@@@@@)
           `YY~~~~YY'
            ||    ||
</pre>

<p>
This setup decreases exposure the most. Remote login is disabled on the public
interfaces of <code>www1</code> and <code>vpn1</code>. In order to log into any
machines a vpn account is required on <code>vpn1</code>. Once on the vpn,
access to the private interfaces of all machines can be gained.
</p>

<p>
This does not replace the need for continuing to follow best practices inside
the private network. Database connections to the db servers should be limited
to hosts that really need to connect to them. Host based firewalls can also be
configured to limit source addresses of remote shell sessions.
</p>

<p>
Great! Now that all the theory is in place what software options are available
to help us implement this?
</p>

<p>
First, ensure you choose a private subnet that is not in use anywhere else.
Common subnets to avoid include 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24,
172.16.0.0/16, 10.0.0.0/8. The first three being commonly used in SOHO
equipment (think consumer-grade linksys/netgear home routers). Perhaps
something like 192.168.30.0/24. Now that a subnet has been chosen, the VPN needs
to be configured.
</p>

<p>

Luckily, some great open source tools make it pretty simple. <a href="http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source.html">OpenVPN</a>
is one such example. OpenVPN is
an SSL-based VPN, so blocked access from a hotel or corporate firewall is
unlikely (this is good for us admins that are on-call 24/7/365). Additionally,
the clients are cross platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) and the setup is not
difficult. In fact check out 
<a href="http://openvpn.net/index.php/access-server/download-openvpn-as.html">OpenVPN Access Server</a>.
OpenVPN Access Server is a package that adds a nice web interface and portal
for VPN users in addition to giving you simple administration of giving you the
VPN. It is free for 2 concurrent connections, if more than 2 concurrent
connections are required the cost is five bucks per concurrent connection.
Licenses must be purchased in packs of 10 at minimum, so a total cost to allow
up to 12 concurrent connections is 50 bucks.
</p>


<p>
Putting your backend servers on a private, hidden network is an important step
in reducing your public network <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface">attack surface</a>. Since
your private network is, well, private, you'll need to implement an access
mechanism to permit you and others to manage the servers in the private
network. Using a VPN to provide this access helps you secure external access to
the private network.
