When you're a sysadmin of several systems, you soon find yourself needing a
centralized `dashboard' (ugh, I hate that term!) of sorts for your systems.
That is, a central monitoring point where, with one or two screens, you can
easily check on the overall health of ALL of your systems.   And yeah, it helps
when the same monitoring tool/suite notifies you 24x7 when something goes awry.
</p>

<p>
In this context, many product names are familiar: Nagios, Zenoss, Hyperic,
OpenNMS, but one that I personally feel that gets overlooked too often is
Xymon.  </p>

<p>
Anyhow, all of the above-mentioned products work well. Some are free, and some
are mostly free unless you wish to purchase support or perhaps value add-ons.
After trying most of them out, I settled on Xymon. Why? Because it's simple,
lightweight, flexible, scalable, and yes, free. The others?  They're all quite
good, but I found them time-consuming to set up, and many of the screens
display "too much" for my liking.   There can indeed be "too much" of a good
thing.  </p>

<p>
Historical note: Xymon is the current name of the project formerly known as
Hobbit. Due to a nastygram the project lead got from the Tolkien estate some
time ago, the project had to be renamed.  You will notice however that portions
of the original project name are still there (configuration file names, for
example).   So long as you know that Hobbit=Xymon, you'll be fine.  </p>

<p>
If you've never seen Xymon, you need to check out the online demo.  I guarantee
it will take you about 60 seconds (or less) to see how it works.  Go to <a
href="http://www.xymon.com">http://www.xymon.com</a>.    You'll see a simple
screen with a few catagories and colored icons: green = good, yellow =
warning, red = bad.  The Xymon "home screen" is quite simple, and is one
of the reasons I like this setup so much.   Simplicity = elegance.  

<p>
Navigating the display is simple. Start with the icon next to "systems."  You'll
see a few servers listed and lots of status icons.  Click on ANY of the status
icons for info.   Click on a CPU icon.  Once you've done that, scroll to the
bottom.  Check out the RRD historical graph at the bottom.  And click on it.
Whoa - lots of history and trend info.   By the way, the online demo is actual
live Xymon monitoring of a few servers belonging to the project's primary
author.  </p>

<p>
After playing with the demo, you will either say "feh", or you'll say "whoa--
this is pretty powerful, yet - simple". For the latter folks: read on.
</p>

<p>
Setting up Xymon is simple.    It's available as RPMs and <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hobbitmon/">source</a>.   I prefer
source.  Compiling it (follow the instructions) is straightforward. By the way,
your distro may still use 'hobbit' as the package name.  I'm not going to go
into how to build and install Xymon, my goal is to describe a few of the key
configuration files that make Xymon work.  Note, as you read on, the simplicity
of the setup. Xymon includes easy hooks into your local apache server.  </p>

<p>
The primary file that drives Xymon is <a
href="http://xymon.com/hobbit/help/manpages/man5/bb-hosts.5.html"><code>
bb-hosts</code></a> (Why bb?  Hobbit..  er..  Xymon is an active branch of the
older, less capable "Big Brother" monitoring package). The
<code>bb-hosts</code> contains the systems you want to monitor.   The first
entry is the Xymon host itself (and is required).     The other two shown in
the example below are two additional servers I want to monitor. (see <a
href="http://xymon.com/hobbit/help/manpages/man5/bb-hosts.5.html">bb-hosts(5)</a>).  </p>

<p>
The basic format of this file is pretty straightforward:   IP and host name.
Other options are available as extra tests per host, such as checking web
pages, verifying oracle is running, and so on.  You can add the options later
as you become familiar with how it all works.  </p>

<pre>
# format is
# ip-address       hostname                # tag1 tag2 ...
192.168.1.10       xyhost                  # bbd apache=http://127.0.0.1/
192.168.1.1        system1
192.168.1.2        system2
</pre>

<p>
Once you get rolling, you can eventually categorize and group the Xymon
display page to your liking. For example, you can have all of your web
servers in one sub-page and all database servers in another sub-page. You
can mix and match, and hosts can occupy multiple sub-pages if you wish. It's
all a simple matter of editing <code>bb-hosts</code> and following examples in
there.  </p>

<p>
The next file that will become of great importance to you is <a
href="http://xymon.com/hobbit/help/manpages/man5/hobbit-alerts.cfg.5.htm
l"><code>hobbit-alerts.cfg</code></a>.   This file describes the notification
actions to take when an event occurs.  </p>

<pre>
SERVICE=conn
 MAIL my.email@my.domain RECOVERED FORMAT=TEXT
</pre>

<p>
The entry above says, "Whenever ANY server is unreachable via a simple
ping, send a detailed message to the email address listed".
There's lots of flexibility here.  You can have alerts sent when only
certain servers fail, and ignore alerts for others.  You can limit the
times of day that alerts are actually sent, and so on. It's important to
not have your Xymon environment "cry wolf" with too many false or chatty
alerts, or everyone will start ignoring them. SMS texting is also available
using out-of-band methods.
</p>

<p>
That's it!   After setting up a hobbit server and configuring only a handful of
simple text files, you now have basic monitoring.  Without anything installed
on clients, hobbit can remotely monitor things like uptime (ping test), http,
ftp, ssh, smtp, and a few others. The power comes in when you install a
little hobbit client on each server. Then, you'll have it all: CPU, memory,
disk, processes (and more). You also have the ability to download/customize
or even write your own tests. There's a ton of available modules you can add.
</p>

<p>
I highly recommend getting started slowly.  After you have basic Xymon
monitoring as outlined above, go ahead and build the client and install it on ONE
of your additional servers above.   Make sure to allow the xymon port (the
default is tcp <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">1984</a>) into the
xymon server.   When you check out the Xymon display, you will notice the
server that has the client running will report a lot more information available
for you to investigate.  </p>

<p>
When I set up a new server (we add stuff weekly), one of my configuration steps
is adding it to the hobbit/xymon monitoring.    On the Xymon server side, I add
one text entry in the bb-hosts file.   On the client side (the new server), I
create a hobbit user account, grab the client tarball that I built earlier, and
untar it in the hobbit user's home directory.   With the final step of adding
an init script, I'm done.   Takes about a minute.  The client is VERY
lightweight, and gathers data using simple available tools like "top", "df",
etc.  </p>

<p>
I like Xymon because it meets the <a href="http://michaelreid.typepad.com/michaelreid/2009/11/kiss-principle.html">"Gene Simmons" principle</a>.   It's simple, and
it's effective.   All of your sysadmin tools should be that way.  </p>
